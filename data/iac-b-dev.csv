There are two lives at stake here, which rarely gets mentioned by people who believe in 'pro-choice'.  There is no way to argue out of the fact that at 8 weeks (and remember that pregnancy is calculated in weeks which begins at the start of the last menstrual period, so the embryo has only been established and growing for 6 weeks) the embryo looks human, has developed reflexes and functioning brain tissue, and very importantly has a fully operational circulatory system, i.e. it's heart is beating.  Now people can argue how aware the embryo is at 6, 7, 8, or 20 weeks or how much pain they can feel, but with out intervention that baby has a 70 plus percent chance of survival and WILL be a human being someday. Those are FACTS that cannot be argued.   The goal of people who are pro-life are not fighting to take rights away from women. They are fighting to GAIN rights for unborn children.  With so many methods of birth control available today for men and women that are affordable and simple to use to PREVENT pregnancy, I don't know why women still choose the option of abortion which is painful, expensive and emotional.

"(571, 0)",2.2,"Change Nobody Believes In  A bill so reckless that it has to be rammed through on a partisan vote on Christmas eve.  Mr. Obama promised a new era of transparent good government, yet on Saturday morning Mr. Reid threw out the 2,100-page bill that the world's greatest deliberative body spent just 17 days debating and replaced it with a new ""manager's amendment"" that was stapled together in covert partisan negotiations. Democrats are barely even bothering to pretend to care what's in it, not that any Senator had the chance to digest it in the 38 hours before the first cloture vote at 1 a.m. this morning. After procedural motions that allow for no amendments, the final vote could come at 9 p.m. on December 24. Even in World War I there was a Christmas truce.  The rushed, secretive way that a bill this destructive and unpopular is being forced on the country shows that ""reform"" has devolved into the raw exercise of political power for the single purpose of permanently expanding the American entitlement state. An increasing roll of leaders in health care and business are looking on aghast at a bill that is so large and convoluted that no one can truly understand it, as Finance Chairman Max Baucus admitted on the floor last week. The only goal is to ram it into law while the political window is still open, and clean up the mess later. *** &#8226; Health costs. From the outset, the White House's core claim was that reform would reduce health costs for individuals and businesses, and they're sticking to that story. ""Anyone who says otherwise simply hasn't read the bills,"" Mr. Obama said over the weekend. This is so utterly disingenuous that we doubt the President really believes it. The best and most rigorous cost analysis was recently released by the insurer WellPoint, which mined its actuarial data in various regional markets to model the Senate bill. WellPoint found that a healthy 25-year-old in Milwaukee buying coverage on the individual market will see his costs rise by 178%. A small business based in Richmond with eight employees in average health will see a 23% increase. Insurance costs for a 40-year-old family with two kids living in Indianapolis will pay 106% more. And on and on.  These increases are solely the result of ObamaCare&#8212;above and far beyond the status quo&#8212;because its strict restrictions on underwriting and risk-pooling would distort insurance markets. All but a handful of states have rejected regulations like ""community rating"" because they encourage younger and healthier buyers to wait until they need expensive care, increasing costs for everyone. Benefits and pricing will now be determined by politics. As for the White House's line about cutting costs by eliminating supposed ""waste,"" even Victor Fuchs, an eminent economist generally supportive of ObamaCare, warned last week that these political theories are overly simplistic. ""The oft-heard promise 'we will find out what works and what does not' scarcely does justice to the complexity of medical practice,"" the Stanford professor wrote.  &#8226; Steep declines in choice and quality. This is all of a piece with the hubris of an Administration that thinks it can substitute government planning for market forces in determining where the $33 trillion the U.S. will spend on medicine over the next decade should go. This centralized system means above all fewer choices; what works for the political class must work for everyone. With formerly private insurers converted into public utilities, for instance, they'll inevitably be banned from selling products like health savings accounts that encourage more cost-conscious decisions. Unnoticed by the press corps, the Congressional Budget Office argued recently that the Senate bill would so ""substantially reduce flexibility in terms of the types, prices, and number of private sellers of health insurance"" that companies like WellPoint might need to ""be considered part of the federal budget."" With so large a chunk of the economy and medical practice itself in Washington's hands, quality will decline. Ultimately, ""our capacity to innovate and develop new therapies would suffer most of all,"" as Harvard Medical School Dean Jeffrey Flier recently wrote in our pages. Take the $2 billion annual tax&#8212;rising to $3 billion in 2018&#8212;that will be leveled against medical device makers, among the most innovative U.S. industries. Democrats believe that more advanced health technologies like MRI machines and drug-coated stents are driving costs too high, though patients and their physicians might disagree.  ""The Senate isn't hearing those of us who are closest to the patient and work in the system every day,"" Brent Eastman, the chairman of the American College of Surgeons, said in a statement for his organization and 18 other speciality societies opposing ObamaCare. For no other reason than ideological animus, doctor-owned hospitals will face harsh new limits on their growth and who they're allowed to treat. Physician Hospitals of America says that ObamaCare will ""destroy over 200 of America's best and safest hospitals.""  &#8226; Blowing up the federal fisc. Even though Medicare's unfunded liabilities are already about 2.6 times larger than the entire U.S. economy in 2008, Democrats are crowing that ObamaCare will cost ""only"" $871 billion over the next decade while fantastically reducing the deficit by $132 billion, according to CBO. Yet some 98% of the total cost comes after 2014&#8212;remind us why there must absolutely be a vote this week&#8212;and most of the taxes start in 2010. That includes the payroll tax increase for individuals earning more than $200,000 that rose to 0.9 from 0.5 percentage points in Mr. Reid's final machinations.  Job creation, here we come. Other deceptions include a new entitlement for long-term care that starts collecting premiums tomorrow but doesn't start paying benefits until late in the decade. But the worst is not accounting for a formula that automatically slashes Medicare payments to doctors by 21.5% next year and deeper after that. Everyone knows the payment cuts won't happen but they remain in the bill to make the cost look lower. The American Medical Association's priority was eliminating this ""sustainable growth rate"" but all they got in return for their year of ObamaCare cheerleading was a two-month patch snuck into the defense bill that passed over the weekend. The truth is that no one really knows how much ObamaCare will cost because its assumptions on paper are so unrealistic. To hide the cost increases created by other parts of the bill and transfer them onto the federal balance sheet, the Senate sets up government-run ""exchanges"" that will subsidize insurance for those earning up to 400% of the poverty level, or $96,000 for a family of four in 2016. Supposedly they would only be offered to those whose employers don't provide insurance or work for small businesses.  As Eugene Steuerle of the left-leaning Urban Institute points out, this system would treat two workers with the same total compensation&#8212;whatever the mix of cash wages and benefits&#8212;very differently. Under the Senate bill, someone who earned $42,000 would get $5,749 from the current tax exclusion for employer-sponsored coverage but $12,750 in the exchange. A worker making $60,000 would get $8,310 in the exchanges but only $3,758 in the current system.  For this reason Mr. Steuerle concludes that the Senate bill is not just a new health system but also ""a new welfare and tax system"" that will warp the labor market. Given the incentives of these two-tier subsidies, employers with large numbers of lower-wage workers like Wal-Mart may well convert them into ""contractors"" or do more outsourcing. As more and more people flood into ""free"" health care, taxpayer costs will explode.

The success of Nazi programs (restoring the economy, dispelling socio-political chaos) and the misappropriation of justice by the apparatus of terror (the Gestapo) assured the compliance of the German people. Arguing otherwise assumes a resistance to Nazi rule that did not exist. Further, supposing the existance of an armed resistance also requires the acceptance that the German people would have rallied to the rebellion. This argument requires a total suspension of disbelief given everything we know about 1930s Germany. Why then did the Nazis introduce this program? As with most of their actions (including the formation of the Third Reich itself), they desired to effect a facade of legalism around the exercise of naked power. It is unreasonable to treat this as a normal part of lawful governance, as the rule of law had been entirely demolished in the Third Reich. Any direct quotations, of which there are several, that pronounce some beneficence to the Weapons Law should be considered in the same manner as all other Nazi pronouncements - absolute lies.

By Noel Sheppard (Bio | Archive) April 25, 2007 - 21:54 ET  It's conceivable that years from now, America's media will be reporting one of the biggest frauds in history: the idea that a wealthy person, for instance, soon-to-be-Dr. Al Gore, can purchase ""carbon credits"" to offset his lavish lifestyle making him quote ""carbon neutral.""  Given the media's love affair with the former vice president as well as advancing man-made global warming hysteria, few American press members have dared to expose this hoax for what it is.  However, on Wednesday, an impeccably reputable publication, the Financial Times, published an article that is a deliciously inconvenient truth for folks like Gore, Laurie David, Sheryl Crow, and all the rest of the alarmists that are actively involved in what years from now will be considered one of the biggest scams ever (emphasis added throughout):http://www.4forums.com/political/297828-post25.html."

What you really are saying is that the safety nets in place are not sufficient, because they do exist. Millions of Americans do not have health insurance, but that does not mean they do not have access to medical care. Could the available resources cover more services, be easier to access and be provided with higher quality, yes without question. EMT's don't ask for proof of insurance before you get on the ambulance. They may take someone to a certain ER, but they get in. Many states have medical services for children and pregnant women. Seniors and disabled have Social Security and Medi-Care along with many other health and social services at the State and Federal level. None of which existed 100 years ago. Not bad considering the country is only 234 years old. Some countries have better health services, some better education opportunities, some overall quality of life, but none rank as high as we do having the freedom and population that we do.   Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness. There is no statement with regards to the quality of that life, that we have freedom to do as we please or that happiness will be acquired. This statement means your life is protected from being taken unjustly (but it happens) we are protected from being unjustly detained (but it happens and is different than freedom) and that unjust are not restrictions are placed on us. The DOI is concerned with the unfair treatment of the people by government. Stating that the government should be and is obligated to the interests of the governed. We the governed forget that our government is supposed to be the collective voice of those being represented.   Who and how is the standard of care to be determined? Do we restrict the pursuit of happiness because certain activities are more likely to require use of resources? Do we mandate preventative care to better manage limited resources? Does this apply to all people or just citizens? Here illegally or legally, but not a citizen?  The desire is noble, the reality imposing, the solution unknown but the the fight worthwhile. Those who choose to participate in the government that governs them, will many times feel frustrated and disappointed, but will always have the potential for their voice to be heard amid the deafening silence of the uncaring masses.",And yet it is the will of the people that must voice this moral obligation. I feel that bitter politics upon both sides has cast a dark cloud over any sort of serious debate over the matter. It is seen more of as a democratic potential victory or a republican loss than the real meaning behind such legislation which is to improve the quality of life among our citizens.  More often than not issues that become important and even dire to our nations well being are simply twisted into political capital rather than seen as an improvement for the common good of all people.

An example is the Tony Martin case:  Tony Martin was a farmer, whose remote farmhouse had been broken in to many times. Martin feared future burglary attempts and the risk of being attacked by a violent burglar. When a pair of burglars broke in while he was home, Martin opened fire with a pump action shotgun. The 16-year-old burglar Fred Barras was killed, and 33-year-old Brendon Fearon was wounded in the leg. Later on that day, the police arrested Tony Martin and charged him with the crimes of murder and wounding with intent. At trial, Martin argued that he had acted in self defense, but the court found that he had fired while they were trying to flee. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, although the conviction was later reduced to manslaughter with a 5 year sentence. The surviving criminal, who had over 30 criminal convictions, then sued Tony Martin for the injury he suffered during the burglary. The parole board refused to grant Tony Martin an early release because he ""has shown no remorse and would continue to pose a danger to any other burglars."" Martin was eventually released from prison after spending years in prison and being vilified by the anti-gun groups in the UK for shooting criminals who had broken into his home.  Another example, from 2009, also shows how the British legal system favors criminals over their victims:  A millionaire businessman has been jailed for attacking a man who held his family hostage in their own home - while the criminal went free. Munir Hussain, who was threatened at knifepoint and tied up by a gang of masked men in his living room last year, was told he must go to prison for 30 months to preserve ""civilised society"". But Walid Salem, a criminal with more than 50 convictions, was handed a two-year supervision order for his role in the break-in at an earlier hearing. He was one of three men who ambushed Mr Hussain, his wife and children as they returned to their home in High Wycombe, Bucks, on Sept 3 last year after attending Ramadan prayers at their local mosque, Reading Crown Court heard. Their hands were tied behind their backs and they were forced to crawl from room to room before being forced to lie down in the living room. But when Hussain's teenage son managed to escape and raise the alarm, he seized his chance and turned on his captors. . . The brothers were found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent by a jury in September. Sentencing, Judge John Reddihough told them it was his ""public duty"" to jailing Munir Hussain for 30 months and his brother for 39 months.

"(842, 4)",1.333333333,"The recent confiscation of a formerly legal firearm has raised questions about how the RCMP inspects imported firearms and has forced a change of national firearms policy.  The RCMP will be physically checking every assault-style rifle that enters the country from now on.  Before the change, verifiers were used to check to make sure the guns are what the exporter said they would be. Verifiers could be anyone with knowledge of firearms and were given a one-day course from the RCMP.  Businesses that sell weapons were able to nominate their own verifiers. But the discovery of a gun the RCMP says should never have made it into Canada has highlighted potential problems with the verifier program.  There is concern that the first loyalty of business verifiers is to the business and that this could hurt the accuracy of the verifications.  ""We've identified an issue with [the program],"" said Marty Cheliak, the director general of the Canadian Firearms Program. ""There's a perception of a conflict of interest that may be prevalent. In this case, we're looking into that for sure.""  Cheliak was referring to the case of the Norinco Type 97A rifle.  Sixty of the Chinese-made guns were imported between December 2006 and November 2007. They were initially classified as restricted, based on information from the importer, photos, specifications from the manufacturer and an inspection by a business-nominated verifier.  In October 2009, the Canada Border Services Agency alerted the RCMP to a second shipment. This time the rifles were given a full physical inspection by the RCMP, which determined the rifles should be prohibited.  ""Why did they make a mistake?"" asked Blair Hagen, president of the National Firearms Association. ""If the RCMP made the mistake in the first place, that has some very serious ramifications.""  In March, the RCMP sent letters to owners of the Norinco Type 97A rifles, demanding they turn in the guns. This came after the RCMP decided the gun was prohibited after determining it could be easily converted to fully automatic fire.  ""It was a purpose-built fully automatic firearm with the fully automatic features disabled by [Norinco] which were not reported to us,"" Cheliak said. ""It is very easily converted back to automatic.""  Automatic weapons, even those converted to semi-automatic fire, are prohibited in Canada. Guns that can be easily converted to fully automatic fire are also prohibited.  The firearms association believes the gun was illegally reclassified, and some members plan to go to court to fight the seizures.  ""The NFA is very concerned about the RCMP's unilateral reclassification of this particular firearm and believes there should be a more transparent process in place to explain it,"" Hagen said.  ""Apparently, they've done a report on this. However, they've refused to release that report. I think what's required here is some transparency.  ""They should demonstrate that to the owners and to the firearms community, so that everyone knows the truth and we can make a determination if the classification was indeed legitimate.""  Cheliak suggested the process is transparent enough.  ""Why would we, the RCMP, or any police service give out information to any group &#8230; on how to convert a firearm from semi-automatic to fully automatic? That's ludicrous.""  Hagen said owners are simply looking for proof. He does not believe that if owners knew how to convert their weapons to fully automatic they would do so.  That quest for proof will be part of the owners' fight in court, where they are questioning the RCMP's ability to reclassify the weapons. Hagen said his understanding of the law is that only the federal cabinet can initiate a reclassification.  However, Cheliak said he doesn't believe the weapon has actually been reclassified, but classified for the first time. A proper classification was done with the physical inspection of the firearm.  Collection of the weapons began in early May. The RCMP say about half of the rifles have been turned in. Those who turned over their weapons were eligible for reimbursement from the Ministry of Public Safety, which is rare.  Public Safety Minister Vic Toews issued a written statement supporting the RCMP's efforts to retrieve the firearms and saying the authorization of compensation ""balances the need for public safety with the legitimate expectations of firearms owners.""  Hagen, of the National Firearms Association, says the RCMP have put the Conservative government, a longtime supporter of the rights of gun owners, in an awkward position.  For now, the owners don't feel the government has turned its back on them.  ""However, as this issue progresses, it is going to raise a lot of questions with the minister and inside the government, and I think the minister needs to be prepared for that."".","So it's just as we've said: registration can and does lead to confiscation down the line. And now we have further proof that we're right about what we say.  Government gets the weapon registered, then they can, at any time and for any reason, demand it be surrendered to the authorities or else punishment will be administered."

"(196, 1)",1.4,"The death toll from fierce street battles in downtown West Kingston has risen to 44 and is expected to climb further as Jamaican security forces continue efforts to flush out the alleged drugs baron Christopher ""Dudus"" Coke.  The latest figures were released after a team led by the public defender Earl Witter and including the Jamaican Red Cross visited the Tivoli Gardens district, scene of the worst fighting.  Witter told local media: ""The police, I gather, have put out a figure of some 26 dead so far. Our own headcount supersedes that. In fact we visited the morgue and were told that no fewer than 35 bodies were lodged there, and most of them were males, mainly young adults."" While at the morgue his team was told of another nine bodies being collected, he said.  At least 37 people are reported to have been injured and the government has appealed for blood donations. In addition 211 people including six women have been detained.  The team was sent in by the Jamaican prime minister, Bruce Golding, following claims of abuse by police and soldiers who stormed the Tivoli Gardens ghetto on Monday in search of Coke, 42, wanted on drug and gun-running charges in the US.  He is still at large, with unconfirmed reports saying he slipped out of Tivoli Gardens on Monday while Jamaican soldiers were engaged in an intense firefight. Civilians have been the main victims during three days of street battles between security forces and gunmen loyal to Coke, the alleged leader of the notorious Shower Posse gang, who have erected barricades of barbed wire and junked cars.  Soldiers have told local media of five-hour gun battles in the streets.  A state of emergency has been declared in the West Kingston area, said to be Coke's stronghold and where he is regarded as a benefactor by many people.  The intensity of the fighting in the heart of the West Kingston slums, which is Golding's own constituency, has taken the government by surprise, the prime minister has admitted. More than 2,000 soliders flooded into the neighbourhood after Jamaica agreed to extradite Coke to the US.  Residents in the no-go area have complained of grenades being thrown by soldiers and of bodies being burned in the streets. Witter said they had seen no evidence of bodies being burned.  Golding told MPs: ""The government deeply regrets the loss of lives, especially those of members of the security services and innocent, law-abiding citizens caught in the crossfire.  ""The security forces were directed to take all practical steps to avoid casualties as much as possible.""  The ""most thorough investigations"" would be undertaken to examine all deaths caused by troops or police, he said. The country's security forces have a reputation for slipshod investigations and being too quick on the trigger.  Security agents would go after ""criminal gunmen in whatever community they may be ensconced"", he said.  Government officials told reporters all the dead civilians in West Kingston were men, but people inside the slums who called local radio stations claimed there had been indiscriminate shooting during the all-out assault by police and soldiers.  Gunmen fighting for Coke describe him as a ""godfather"" figure who helps provide services and protection to the poor West Kingston community. The services and protection are allegedly funded by a criminal empire that seemed untouchable until the US demanded his extradition.  Coke, also known as the President, has built a loyal following and turned the neighbourhood into his stronghold. One placard seen at a barricade read: ""Jesus died for us. We will die for Dudus.""  US authorities claim he has amassed a vast arsenal in his Kingston home turf and has been trafficking cocaine to the streets of New York since the mid-90s, allegedly hiring island women to hide the drugs on themselves on flights to the US.  The UK Foreign Office is advising British nationals to avoid the areas of West Kingston - Tivoli and Denham Town in particular - and Mountain View because of ""substantial unrest including gunfire"".  ""There remains an increased risk of further outbreaks of civil disorder and street violence in Kingston and possibly in other urban centres in Jamaica,"" says the Foreign Office advice.  The Shower Posse, referred to by the FBI as ""the most violent and notorious criminal organisation ever in America"", is believed responsible for more than 1,000 deaths in the US and Jamaica during the cocaine wars of the 1980s.  Earning its name from its ""showering"" of bullets at rivals during gun battles, it operates mainly in Jamaica, the US and Canada. A splinter group called the President Click is known to have operated in the UK - in parts of Brixton in south London known as Little Tivoli.  Former Shower Posse leaders include Coke's father, Lester Coke, who died in a mysterious fire in his prison cell in 1992 while awaiting extradition to the US on drug and murder charges.","44 dead in just one day, in a drug battle. On an island nation no less.  And take a look at the video. Those are M16s being carried by the Jamaican government's soldiers.

If we cannot make and enforce common sense gun control laws that both sides can agree on, neither side will ever stop. If a buy back was ever proposed in America, very few guns would be sold.

His lawyer after 20 years of him being on death row came up with ""retardation"" Mind you he ""walked"" 3 times.. all of which I was there to witness. I was to be a witness to the execution by request of my grandmother who has passed on. anyway at the last minute he got a stay of execution. Back to the drawing table.. Last year after several hearings, they came to the conclusion the he was mentally retarded..scoring a 75 on his IQ test. The limit for the death penalty is 70. He was a high school graduate, had a family, held jobs.. and clearly competent, nonetheless they found him otherwise. So now he is off death row, and the DA has told me that it is possible he could get parole eventually. With all that it has been a very trying time for me and I have had to struggle with how I really felt about the death penalty. I have been a supporter but never really could my put heart into my conviction. I do not know if it is out of revenge or not, hard to say I am too close to the matter.

I put so many years of waiting for that moment... it sounds kind of sick, but as much as I dreaded witnessing it, I also looked forward to it. I do think that maybe life in prison may be better, only if his experience there is just awful.... but the revenge side of me, just wants him to suffer what my father suffered. but if you were to ask me to think about this the old fashion way, which would be I should be the one to flip the switch .. not so sure I could do it. so with all that I still don't really know if I in my heart, support the death penalty or I am just after revenge.

And if the NRA is really interested in enforcing laws why do they ask congress to reduce the budget of law enforcement? The NRA uses its political muscle to make it easier for criminals to obtain guns. Robert Ricker, former top lawyer of the NRA, talks about it.    So if you're really interested in enforcing gun laws, don't support the NRA.","""What is true, Ricker says, is that gun manufacturers have long known that distributors and retailers supply thousands of guns each year to criminals, and yet gun makers deliberately look the other way. ""  The quote says it all. That attitude breaks many cornerstone laws regarding personal responsibility. Manufactures are NOT responsible for customers illegal activity.  GM and Ford know that 100% of all the product they sell will be used illegally. Everyone of their cars will be used to break speed limits. No one obeys speed limts, the only time speed limits are obeyed is when a cop is watching. Yet GM and Ford are not responsible for all the illegal activity of their products.  Shifting the responsbility for enforcement breaks many traditions and laws regarding individual personal responsibility. When a customer breaks a law using a product, manufactures are not responsible, that goes for both guns and cars, or any product that is sold and used for criminal purposes.  There certainly a lack of cooperation between the ATF and the NRA. They really should be working together. It takes two sides to make a conflict. The ATF is trying to single out gun manufactures to be responsible for policing customers. NO OTHER INDUSTRY is being held accountable like that. That is why there is a conflict between the NRA and ATF. The NRA asks that gun manufactures to be treated with the same consideration of existing laws and standards applied to other industries. The NRA supports any efforts to take firearms away from criminals, but they are asking that gun manufactures not be held accountable for customer illegal activity. Which is the position of every single product manufacturer not matter what you make and sell.  It is not that gun manufactures are looking away, they do. So does every other manufacture who makes any other product."

You can point the following facts out to those who tell us we are XXXXXX in kansas who do not know how to run our schools:  ACT Scores: Kansas has the 8th highest national scores; the highest combination of scores and percentage of students tested.

Only one state had a higher average score and percentage of students at or above proficient level than Kansas for fourth grade; only two states scored higher at eighth grade.   There is a lot of stuff that pandion is saying ""you don't learn in high school"" that my teachers tell me they are teaching. Then again, we also rank first when it comes to introducing college level curriculum to in our high schools.   Maybe that is another reason that this is an issue brought up in kansas.

Evolution is basically the change in allelle frequency over time. It helps explain how life adapts, changes and how we and modern animals came to be, not how life orignally started. That's another topic and theory.   Life probably started through abiogenesis, which God conflicts with more. Life probably started with one molecule and went on, forming more complex organisms due to certain conditions and stimuli.","Among the icons (idols) of modern mysticism there is one that reigns supreme. It is the myth of evolution. We scoff at the gods of the anchient pagans as if we were untouched by their superstition and yet we mystify our science with the likes of Darwin, the high priest of natural selection. Darwin taught a fable that started in a warm little pond and through a process that has became known as gradualism (minute changes over eons) all life arose out of a primordial soup.   Life is not chaotic it is orderly and requires replication. Without this you just have a lot of chemicals mixing in an infinite variety. The reason that life must be derived from life (biogenesis) in the minds of most is that this is the only way we have ever seen it happen. ""You can imagine anything you like but you can only understand the truth"" as Newton said. Now if amino acids are the mirror image of nucleic acid sugars and this in true of all living things then we are limited to this as fundamental to life. This in my opinion is the fundamental first step and it cannot happen peicemeal, it all has to happen all at once.

We had light and dark moths before the industrial revolution, we now still have light and dark moths. The only thing that has changed is the population ratio, assumably by *natural selection*. Natural selection is not proof of evolution by any means. Creationists recognise it and accept it as it goes in nicely with the creationary model.   Natural selection is basically the death of a particular type of animal if they are unsuited to the environment. In a given environment (e.g. a very cold region), some (e.g. the long-haired dogs) will be more likely to survive, and so pass on their information, than others. Natural selection can favour some sets of information above others, and can eliminate some of the existing information in the population, but it can't create any new information.   An example, consider the cold environment mentioned above. We take a population of both long, short and medium, haired dogs to this environment. Over time, very short time, the population will only consist of the long haired dogs as the short and medium haired dogs would freeze and be wiped out by the cold conditions. So, as a result, the population as a whole has lost the information for making short haired dogs and has not gained any new information. What did we have when we first took the dogs to the environment? Dogs (varying in hair sizes). What did we get after a short amount of time? Dogs (only the long hair size). There is no evolution occuring here, we had dogs before, dogs after. The only difference is that the gene for making short hair has been eradicated from the population by natural selection -- that is it. This is the essense of natural selection - and goes in nicely with the Biblical account of our origins, i.e. variation within a kind and that kind's have the ability to only lose information - not gain it.  So even if the peppered moth case was really true, and not a fraud, it still would not be evidence for evolution as opposed to creation. Anyone who says other wise, does not really know what they are talking about unless new genetic information is somehow being added to the moth's total DNA content, i.e. their genome, in which case you might have a point.  Would any creationists like to challenge anything about this article or the concept?   His method appears to be good, i.e. using observations and experimental data, as well as repeatability. He is using the scientific method (in reverse as he is collecting the observations and experimental data and then will draw a conclusion based on the evidence and possibly his own bias. This is yet to be determined, however. Can you keep us informed of his progress?","Also another example put forward is a bacteria that can only sustain itself by eating Nylon. The theory goes - nylon is a recent invention therefore this bacteria must have eolved recently. What it suggests however is that a portion of an existing population would have died if not for nylon... the bug has to have nylon, or it will die. It is akin to looking at a portion of the human population who would die from heart-trouble. But thankfully we've now got artificial hearts, therefore this portion can survive. They are not a new species of human, but live only because of a recent invention."

"(1359, 5)",0,Why are trying to prove that God exists or does not exist based on the design of our eye? First of all if you want proof that our bodies are poorly designed you can look at more things than just our eye. The same goes for the complexities of our bodies design although I would think that the downsides are much worse and more common.,"Except for possible exception of a couple evangelistic atheists, the design argument is from the creationist side. It is pretty old being first stated by William Paley. Darwin respected Paley and thought his arguments beautiful until he actually started looking at reality (Darwin also lived in that same rooms at Christ's College, Cambridge that Paley did). The argument from design is presented as ""proof"" of God or an ""intelligent"" designer for those who want to pretend that intelligent design creationism ins't creationism. But the argument on the other side is that it is flawed design and therefore isn't ""proof"". Evolutionary biologists don't assert that there is not god, only that there is no evidence from nature that there is one.  Science is naturalistic. Even if some scientists (and others) are philosophical naturalists, science doesn't work that way. It is methodological naturalism simply because there are no tools by which science can examine or quantify the supernatural. It sounds silly when some claim that scientists are wrong when they fail to consider the supernatural in naturalism."

If you are looking at life for robbing a bank, you may as well use a rocket launcher and an M-60 as use a handgun. This would virtually ensure that the police would not get you, as most police departments on the planet are not equipped to deal with heavy machine guns and rocket launchers. If hte penalty is the same though, why not?  People tend to miss the most obvious (and most dangerous) way to institute gun control That is to restrict the sale and manufacture of bullets. Without bullets, your gun is nothing but a paper weight. Bullets are also much more difficult to produce than guns. While they can be reloaded, casings are incredibly difficult to make on a small scale. The only way to really do it is to turn them down one at a time on a lathe. Dogs CAN be used to sniff out gunpowder and primers.  This is a danger I think people miss when they start bannign certain types of ammunition.

Would you agree that abstinence would be the best protection a woman has against these negative health risks? Would you support abstinence to protect women's health?","To answer your question, yes I would support abstinence to protect anyone's health, not just women's. Risks of STIs including AIDS and unwanted pregnancy are obvious examples that can be largely avoided by not having sex.  Cervical cancer is triggered by a virus that a woman is exposed to through sex. Even if she does not contract any STD, there is a high correlation between rates of cervical cancer, HPV(human papolloma virus), and having intercource. Cervical cancer almost never occurs in virgins, and there is a high rate of occurrence in women who have had multiple sex partners.  Abstinent women also have lower rates of urinary tract infections and vaginitis. Those can be caused by skin being dragged into the vagina inadvertently during intercourse, and the penis has bacteria on it just like all skin.  Teenage girls also would obviously have higher levels of academic achievement if they are abstinent. Less depression and emotional turmoil due to relationship problems if they are abstinent, as well as less domestic or partner abuse.  However, I don't believe that advocating abstinence only is a smart way of approaching a problem. Obviously very few people are abstinent all of their lives; intercourse is a normal part of a healthy lifestyle. Preaching abstinence-until-marriage is also an unreachable goal and means nothing to same-sex couples. Furthermore, there is little scientific evidence that shows that abstinence only education works. Research demonstrates that comprehensive sex education, including abstinence and contraception, is the most effective, according to well-respected groups including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Society for Adolescent Medicine, the Institute of Medicine, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association. All of these groups reject abstinence only programs in favor of comprehensive sex education.

My understanding is that anti-evolutionists refused to accept that natural selection could have led to the diversification of species. Until recently, when they realized that evolutionary theory could help out in their how-many-animals-could-fit-on-the-ark dilemma; now they suddenly take an idea from evolutionary science and propose that suddenly all the present species could ""micro-evolve"" from a few ancestral ""kinds"" on the ark."

I prefer to use the term ""spontaneous origin"" rather than ""evolution""). since creationism and the collection of spontaneous origin theories are mutually exclusive and cannot coexist, then upon proving either you automatically disprove the other. and if a 3rd unforseen theory is proven as the real way life originated on earth, then it would automatically disprove the both creationism and the current spontaneous origin theories  the 2 concepts are pretty much diametrically opposed right now, both competing for evidence to support its case, and a strengthening of one theory automatically implies a weakening of the other."

I recall reading in my college psychology textbooks that the concept labeled 'self-awareness' doesn't happen until many months after birth. At the end of the day, in order to answer the question, I think you'd need a pretty solid definition of self-awareness, and coming to agreement on what 'self-awareness' is or should be may not be an easy task.  In a strictly biological sense, there is no debate that the biological life of a mammal begins at the point of conception/fertilization. There is no reasonable dispute to this observed fact. Only when subjective terms such as 'self-awareness' and 'personhood,' etc. come into play can there be valid debates. Show me a biologist or embryologist who states that the biological development of a unique mammal does not begin at conception/fertilization, and I'll show you a semantics game. ;)   It is perfectly valid for someone to have the opinion that 'life' begins with recordable brain activity (as early as 40-days post-conception)... or 'self-awareness' or any other such concept, or when the entity would be 'viable' outside the womb. But there are varying levels of brain activity. There is no agreed upon definition of self-awareness. And viability is an ever-changing concept (a 12-week fetus was delivered recently in Minnesota, and as far as I know is still alive and doing well -- please feel free to update me if you have heard any other news).

I am not discussing the God/Person of Jesus specifically. I am not discussing whether or not Jesus is the Son of God, who rose from the dead in atonement for our sins and the sins of the whole world.

To believe that Jesus actually rose from the dead and ascended into heaven, one must have faith.

It takes faith to believe that those human beings were inspired by God. It takes faith to believe that what they describe actually happened the way they describe it.  What I can say with certainty that cannot be disputed as far as I'm aware, is that whatever happened... happened.

It looks about the same in Europe.  http://www.birdguides.com/html/vidlib/assetPictures/061015a001_j2.jpg  They also range to the west from Alaska into Siberia, across Siberia and Russia all the way to northern Europe. But as you go further and further west their appearance begins to change. But there is never a place where neighboring populations cannot and do not interbreed. But in northern Europe the populations from the west look a bit different.  http://www.birdguides.com/html/vidlib/assetPictures/061018a001_j2.jpg  That's the Lesser black-backed gull (L. fuscus). Even though it shares the same range as the herring gull it does not interbreed with herring gulls. So here is one large population that has become two different species at the extremes of its range, and those extremes overlap. So the American herring gull is a transitional between the Herring gull and the Lesser black-backed gull. It is even thought that the original population from which all of these birds descended lived in North America."

"(78, 6)",-2.2,"O.k., lets go through your scenario. The government has been toppled and the standing army has been crushed. Somehow all Americas nuclear arms were obliterated. The invading force has successfully instituted a dictatorship and is now systematically destroying our personal freedoms.   Now suppose the year is 1799 and the population rises up. The five rounds with 200 million guns, works. The population overthroughs the invading army through sheer numbers, though the price is high in terms of casualties. America is once again free and the democratic system is once again put in place.  The year is 2004, the population is no longer fit and tough from working in the fields to get their own food. But each of the 400 million people has a gun, with lets say 30 rounds each. The population now has 12 billion rounds, and lets assume each round is an armour piercing bullet with long range capabilities, and lets also assume for the hell of it, that each gun is a machine gun with long-range single shot abilities and a scope (just for fun).   Same situation, same invading force. The population rises up, taking along with them the few remaining rockets and bombs from the few remaining weapons caches. Lets say 2 million hand-held anti-plane missiles, 4 million anti-tank missiles and for even more fun, lets say they have a genius military leader who has somehow the ability to maintain instant contact with any unit anywhere, and is the greatest tactical mind the planet has ever know.  To overthrough the standing American army the invading force must have had massive numbers of planes, tanks and naval units.   First off, 4 million anti-tank weapons is not much when put against 400 million people, so you have a lot of venerable areas. Where ever the militia units try to form, they are killed by tanks, even though many of the tanks with infantry backing are destroyed the army keeps going because to over through America who has the greatest tanks in the world, you would have to have like 10-1 ratio on the American armed divisions.   But, wait. Lets assume somehow the ground forces of well-organized troops and tanks is defeated by the population. Lets assume the invading army again somehow lost all its ground units, lets pretend the enemy forces had exactly 4 million tanks, and the ratio of shot-to-kill was perfect.   To defeat the American army of planes you would, again, have to have massive numbers (or technology superior planes). So the population tries shooting down the planes, but the planes would usually get away because modern planes can take out a ground-based target with out ever going closer the a couple miles.   But again, wait. Somehow, without losing so many troops as not to be able to defeat the massive mechanized occupying force, all planes are spotted (miles away) and shoot down by the UNTRAINED militia. The genius military leaders (who no body though to kill) work no doubt.   Yet still, the population is defeated because if I remember correctly, the militia doesn't have naval units. So even if all the inland forces could be killed, the majority of costal forces would be protected by barrages from the enemy naval force (which is very large because it had to defeat the American navy, the greatest in the world technologically).  But lets assume, the population just swims to the invading ships, kills the crews, and uses the ships they stole to kill the other enemy ships. Thank god for that tactical genius at the helm of the American resistance.   I am actually guessing that invading force must be like 20 times bigger then America's armies for one simple reason. The only way you could defeat the American ICBMs is to have a blitzkrieg (I know my spelling sucks) like attack. Most of the ICBM silos aren't connected to the internet, mainly because the government knows the silos would be venerable to internet attack, so any rebuttal involving the virus-like disabling of the nuclear stockpile is gone.  Now, you may be wondering what am I trying to say here. Well its simple, if somehow, just somehow, the entire military force of the U.S. was obliterated, it would take just one ICBM hit on the enemy's capital city to make attack impossible.   Again, the blitzkrieg like attack? Even if that worked the U.S., like Russia and a few other nuclear powers, keeps stockpiles of nuclear weapons hidden underground in the invent of being taken over, and the underground stockpiles usually have several rockets with enough range to blast the heck out of the closest invading army. So it would never happen that the U.S. would be left nuclear-naked.  But lets assume that happened (maybe during a really, REALLY cool party some idiot colonel peed on them, and they just fried). The genius military commander did somehow take out the entire invading force of air, ground and sea. You still have to deal with the fact that whoever invaded the U.S. probably spend several trillion doing it ( I know, that's a pretty low number for the invasion of America), and in that case most likely have satellites and long-range missiles (again lets assume somehow America's own just fell out of the sky and the invading force got even guys together to be able to take out all America's nuclear silos including the underground stockpiles which each have own guard forces of soldiers training night and day for such an event).   The hugest, most glaring problem with the militia, unless every one the 400 million militia units somehow got a radio and a laptop, they would have to gather. And if they gathered in the numbers they would need to gather in, to order to defeat the large invading army, they would be taken out very easily by 1. ICBMs launched from enemy subs 2. Prominent meetings between our military genius and his supporters stopped by snipers with a 1.5 mile range and superb training and intelligence (remember those satellites) 3. all groups preparing for ""battle"" so to speak could be taken out as they are marching or driving or whatever by mortars, ambushes, rockets, infantry rushes, tank columns etc. before they knew what hit them.  4. It would take a lot of planning to get 400 million people to fight, and assuming everybody has a laptop with wireless capability, they would still need satellites for the military genius in California to command units in N.Y., N.Y., and....wait America's satellites are gone and if the invading force could do that, it wouldn't be that hard to take out commercial internet satellites in geoscyhronize orbit (effectively sitting ducks). And any land based networks would be destroyed in the first few hours of insurrection.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------- But militia units only have guns, and they would get their butts whooped, even with massive numbers. What you are saying is only true about Napoleonic tactics, in today's modern warfare almost completely infantry-based armies are obsolete and very venerable   No the afghan war is not a valid counterpoint, the terrain was different, the people are more hardened, the weapons were supplied by a military power superior to the Russians, the afghans had unlimited anti-tank reserves, had incredibly extensive cave networks in which to hide, plan and attack, only had to defeat, on the majority, other infantry battalions because of the terrain in which armoured vehicles could not cross, the Russians were under funded and their moral low, the soviets had already been beaten down by large amounts of smaller fights across the cracking Soviet Empire, china needed to be supplied with more troops as it started to look toward independence, Afghanistan is nowhere near water eliminated the possibility of naval back-up by the very crappy Russian naval forces, the afghans received help from the rest of the Arab world which would not happen with the U.S. because if an enemy can take out the U.S., it could probably take out the combined forces of Europe and North America, and, finally, the afgans didn't have nukes so they had to defend themselves with their own two hands, but america has nukes and if ever anything tryed to do what is in the above senario they would get blasted because unlike the russians in afganhistan, the americans would be defended their homeland.   Neither is the French revolution a good-counter point, as I have said, your tactics only work with Napoleonic-style battles and guess what kind of battle were happening when Napoleon the 3rd was in power? (in case you didn't learn it in school, Napoleon the 3rd, napoleon's nephew, was in power during the french revolution)   Trust me, cause the only thing I love more then physics is military tactics and warfare.   ----As I have shown in more detail, Treat2 is right, it wouldn't work.------   The other amendments don't pertain to retaining the sovereignty of the U.S.A, they pertain to the basic rights each citizen enjoys and therefore will always be important and ""In Fashion"" so long as the U.S. still has human citizens.

"(174, 5)",-3.2,Why do Americans want so many guns?  emoticon_xkill   What are you most afraid of?,One has to wonder why gun haters always ask this quesion.   Has this question ever been asked of people that read books? It is interesting how people that want to ban the right to bear arms never apply their logic to the rights they like. The gun haters clearly like the 1st amend.   The gun haters use their 1st amend right to attack the right to bear arms. When racist use their 1st amend right to attack other peoples right it is called hate speech. So why is it that gun haters demanding the banning of the right to bear arms is not considered hate speech? After all gun haters are just like the other hate groups. All they do is attack the right to bear arms. Not once has a gun hater ever demand that dangerous criminals be punished.

What about love, trust, respect, companionship? My wife and I may decide to not have a child, does that mean our marriage should be made illegal?

"(364, 4)",-3.8,"It is a true transition form, but the argument is whether several different reptile-bird transitionals evolved and which one actually is the ancestor of the birds.","Actually, no. A specific fossil cannot be, and probably will never be, identified as the ancestor of birds with any certainty. It is doubtful that the fossil record will ever be so complete as to make that possible. Your remark tends to support the confusion of creationists. They tend to represent the idea of a transitional as ancestral. Since the ancestral status of any particular fossil can't be acertained for any given fossil, and since any given fossil is usually placed in one of the major taxonomic groups, creationists feel justified in claiming that it is just a bird - thus, no transitionals exist.  But if you look at life you will see that it is like a bush with many branches. What is being discovered in China is part of the bush that was the lineage from theropod to avian, as was Archaeopteryx. That bush is what is expected from evolutionary theory. There are several fossils that show a progression from dinosaur to bird. We don't expect a ladder-like chain of a single lineage that evolved until a point that it branched into the birds. There are many lines along that path that went no where but were similar to the one that became the birds."

Places which have proper access and education have far fewer unwanted pregancies as well. The USA has twice as many unwanted pregancies as Canada and I think 36 times as many as Japan.  BTW, an interesting fact is that the USA (280 million} is now the 3rd most populous nation in the world right after China (1.3 billion), and India (1 billion). The former USSR had been 3rd, I think, with a little over 300 million."

No. Do they have maternity wards? No. What do they do? They give out pregnancy tests and do abortions. That's where they get their money- a quarter of all their revenue is from pre 13-week abortions. This is not even countig their later more expensive abortons that are also so common! They get $40 million a year for abortions alone.","parcum, they are like any other medical facility, saying this is like saying that just because my physician just happens to be do some surgeries, he will always tell me I need to have a surgery- because of course, he will make more money off me then. You dont like the fact that planned parenthood performs abortions, and so you feel the need to slanderize them. Some rabid pro=lifer told you that, and you swallowed it hook, line and sinker. You obviously have no clue into the idea of customer service- which is the field I work in. You try to do whatever is in the best interest of the customer, even if it sends them to your competition. IN the case of planned parenthood, it is against their policy to recommend that a patient do anything but dicuss it with their own support system, be that friends, family, clergy or whatever. Any employee of theirs who breaks that policy is making them liable for legal recourse, and will also be likely to lose their job.   I wonder, does your high school offer logic courses?

A theory is a model to try to explain the FACTS. WHen it comes to evolution, the theory of evolution is a model to try to explain the observed fact that evolution happens.   Second of all, Humans and modern apes share the same ancestor. From a biological point of view, humans ARE apes that have a specialised brain.  The third problem is many religious people take much of the bible as allegorical. That means they are able to reconcilate such things as scientific fact, (evolution, expanding universe, age of the universe, biology, geology and physics), and their belief in God."
