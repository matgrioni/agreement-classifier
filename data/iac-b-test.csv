This 2% of human DNA is converted into intermediary molecules called RNAs, which in turn carry instructions within cells for protein manufacture. ""And what of the other 98% of the genome? It has been assumed by many to be genetic junk, a massive accumulation of ""code"" that evolution has rendered superfluous. Now, however, scientists are discovering that the vast bulk of the DNA in our genomes, while it does not ""code"" for the specific RNA molecules that serve as templates for protein synthesis, do nevertheless perform various kinds of work."".","It is not only supposedly ""junk DNA"" that was used for these kind of arguments. The vertebrate eye has been preached to be a bad design. Why? Why is it a bad design?  The human eye contain bona fide optical fibers to conduct light (nice illustration). Besides the design arose 40-60 times during evolution, like evolution was biased (converged on an optimal design) towards such a structure. So why is it sub optimal? Are proponents of these arguments going to suggest a better design with all the blueprints? Thought not, arguments from ignorance are short on design :p.

Glover, The Human Vermiform Appendix-a General Surgeon's Reflections, CEN Technical Journal, 3:31-38, 1988.  In short: The appendix contains a high concentration of very specialized structures called lymphoid follicles (also found throughout the GIT). Lymphoid follicles in the appendix produce cells that produce antibodies that control which essential bacteria come to reside in the caecum and colon in neonatal life. The ""strategic"" placement of the appendix is important during the development of neonatal life in the setup of healthy intestinal flora therefore neonatal appendectomy will impair mucosal immunity. ""The appendix's job is to reboot the digestive system..."" and ""acts as a good safe house for bacteria,"".  It might not be that important in later life and it can be removed, but so can your one kidney, your stomach, an eye, small intestines, reproductive organs etc. Are these bad designs then as well? See... these arguments have no force. Empty arguments from ignorance...  And the cilium? Until the 1990s, the prevailing view of the primary cilium was that it was merely a vestigial organelle, without important function (wiki). Seems like pretty high-tech structures to me?

"(441, 5)",3.4,"It is quite understandable that religiously motivated opposition to same-sex civil marriage shapes the basis for legal opposition to same-sex marriage, even if only indirectly. Religious objections to same-sex marriage are supported by thousands of years of tradition and biblical interpretation. The belief that the ""sanctity of marriage"" would be undermined by the inclusion of gay and lesbian couples bears a striking conceptual resemblance to the expressed secular rationale for maintaining the tradition of marriage as a union between dual-gender couples, but better identifies the source of the opposition. Whether expressly or impliedly, much of society rejects same-sex marriage due to sincere, deeply ingrained- even fundamental-religious belief.  Yet, such views are not the only religious views of marriage. As demonstrated by amicus groups, other equally sincere groups and people in Iowa and around the nation have strong religious views that yield the opposite conclusion.31  This contrast of opinions in our society largely explains the absence of any religion-based rationale to test the constitutionality of Iowa's same-sex marriage ban. Our constitution does not permit any branch of government to resolve these types of religious debates and entrusts to courts the task of ensuring government avoids them. See Iowa Const. art. I, Â§ 3 (""The general assembly shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . . . .""). The statute at issue in this case does not prescribe a definition of marriage for religious institutions. Instead, the statute declares, ""Marriage is a civil contract"" and then regulates that civil contract. Iowa Code Â§ 595A.1. Thus, in pursuing our task in this case, we proceed as civil judges, far removed from the theological debate of religious clerics, and focus only on the concept of civil marriage and the state licensing system that identifies a limited class of persons entitled to secular rights and benefits associated with civil marriage. _____ 31 Many religions recognize same-sex marriage, such as Buddhists, Quakers, Unitarians, and Reform and Reconstructionist Jews. Schuman, 96 Geo. L.J. at 2108. Amicus curiae Iowa and National Faith Leaders, Communities, and Scholars point out the United Church of Christ encourages, but does not require, its local congregations to adopt wedding policies that do not discriminate between heterosexual, gay, and lesbian couples, while the Episcopal Church permits priests to perform liturgies and blessings at same-sex weddings as a matter of pastoral care. Additionally, many groups and clergy within various religions are working to achieve inclusion of same-sex marriage. Id. at 2108-09.",Wise words!
"(1163, 6)",3.2,"Vermont legalizes gay marriage -- chicagotribune.com  chicagotribune.com Vermont legalizes gay marriage The Associated Press  6:57 PM CDT, April 7, 2009  MONTPELIER, Vt. -- The marriage proposal came not over a candlelit dinner or on a scenic mountaintop; instead the couple were surrounded by a throng of gay rights supporters outside the Vermont House chamber.  ""We haven't decided who's going to propose to who yet,"" former lawmaker Robert Dostis said as he stood next to his longtime partner, Chuck Kletecka. ""But we've been together 25 years in September, and I think September 14th would be a nice wedding day.""  ""Sounds good to me,"" Kletecka replied. ""I accept.""  The exchange came just after the Vermont House narrowly achieved the two-thirds majority necessary to overcome Republican Gov. Jim Douglas' veto of a gay marriage bill.  Vermont was the first state to give gay and lesbian couples legal recognition with its civil unions law in 2000. It jumped to the lead again Tuesday: After courts in three other states had legalized gay marriage, Vermont became the first to have its Legislature do so on its own.  Bills to allow same-sex marriage are currently before lawmakers in New Hampshire, Maine, New York and New Jersey. The three other states that allow same-sex marriage -- Connecticut, Massachusetts and Iowa -- moved to do so first through the courts, not their legislatures.  ""For a popularly elected legislature to make this decision is a much more democratic process"" because lawmakers have to answer to the voters every other November, said Eric Davis, a retired Middlebury College political science professor.  Courts typically deal with arcane points of constitutional law. While legislatures debate some of the same principles, the process may become much more personal. In Vermont, some of the most gripping debate came when gay lawmakers took to the House floor last Thursday and told their own love stories.  Getting gay marriage approved in a political, rather than purely legal, forum is a big step, said Boston University law professor Linda McLain, an expert on family law and policy.  ""What may give courage to other legislatures is that this legislature managed to do it,"" she said.  She added that using the civil rights language of equality -- the measure in Vermont was dubbed the marriage equality bill -- could help make gay marriage more acceptable elsewhere.  Opponents said they, too, believe activists will be emboldened in other states and could attack the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman and provides that states need not recognize the marriage of a same-sex couple from another state. The Vermont action comes just days after the Iowa Supreme court ruled that not permitting gay marriage there was unconstitutional.  ""To the millions of Americans who care about marriage, we say, 'Get ready. President Obama and Democrats will use Vermont as an excuse to overturn the bipartisan federal Defense of Marriage Act,'"" said Brian Brown, executive director of the National Organization for Marriage, which waged a radio campaign against the measure. ""The next step is to ask the Supreme Court to impose gay marriage on all 50 states.""  To date, the same-sex marriage movement's main gains have been in New England, which some attribute to Yankee liberalism and the gradual acceptance of gay relationships after Vermont's groundbreaking civil unions law took effect in 2000.  Douglas had announced his intent to veto the gay marriage bill two weeks ago, saying he believed marriage should be limited to a man and a woman and calling the issue a distraction from more important economic and budgetary issues.  In Tuesday's vote, a yes was needed from two-thirds of those present to override the governor's veto. The goal was easily achieved in the Senate, which voted 23-5, but in the House the vote was much closer, 100-49.  The speaker's announcement of the results to a packed Statehouse chamber set off whistles and cheers among supporters whose hopes had been temporarily dashed when the governor announced he would veto the measure if it passed the Legislature.  Among the celebrants were Kletecka and Dostis, who recalled efforts to expand gay rights dating to an anti-discrimination law passed in 1992.  ""It's been almost 20 years to get to this point,"" Dostis said. ""I think finally, most people in Vermont understand that we're a couple like any other couple. We're as good and as bad as any other group of people.""  Craig Bensen, a gay marriage opponent who had lobbied unsuccessfully for a nonbinding referendum on the question, said his side was outspent by supporters by 20-1.  ""The other side had a highly funded, extremely well-oiled machine with all the political leadership except the governor pushing to make this happen,"" he said. ""The fact that it came down to this tight a vote is really astounding.""  The measure had only 95 yes votes when it passed the House on Friday. But some changed their votes Tuesday.  Rep. Jeff Young, D- St. Albans, who voted no twice because he's philosophically opposed to gay marriage, joined most other Democrats in voting to override Douglas' veto.  ""I think if I wanted to continue my career here and have any chance of being effective, I had to vote with my caucus,"" he said. ""You have some pet projects, you think you can help your district back home with things that need to happen. I want to get a railroading bill through. I wouldn't even have had a chance to testify, let alone get it through. Now, people will listen to me. It's the way the political game is played.""  Copyright 2009 Associated Press.

Hepburn A friend sent me a link to your paper on gun-law counts. http://www.brookings.edu/es/urban/publications/gunbook4.pdf Your finding of approximately 300 major state gun laws appears to be incorrect. California alone has 541 numbered statutes of gun law, twice what the federal government has passed.  We publish the gun laws for several states, and distribute books on the subject for 24 states. Our definition for a gun law, while slightly different than yours, is close enough and guides our selection -- with a need to include no extraneous material that would increase the girth and cost of our books.  If it affects private ownership, possession or use of firearms, it is included. A huge list of laws that are not included, which would raise the counts dramatically, is printed in the front of each of our books (e.g., regs for police, criminals, military, Native Americans, federal officials, etc.; 55 numbered federal statutes deal solely with armed federal agents).  Gun-law counts are somewhat preposterous though because, for example, a single law can regulate numerous disparate subjects. The Brady law, for example, with its 3,000 words, controls airline baggage, point-of-sale purchases, development and maintenance of an FBI computer gun-tracking system and much more. Counting it as ""one law"" would be hopelessly misleading if the goal is to determine how much gun law exists.  For specifics, I can tell you affirmatively that at last count there were 271 numbered federal gun-controlling statutes; Texas had 226; Arizona 183; Florida 229; and Virginia, in out just released 7th edition, has 193. Your overall count of 300 would therefore seem to come up somewhat short, wouldn't you agree?  You'll find background and and extended discussion of true counts here: gunlaws.com - FAQ  The real question though is this: Is there any criminal gun-related activity that is not already banned? The answer to that is no, and usually there are multiple bans for any nefarious activity you can imagine. New proposals invariable seek to criminalize possession by the public, possession which is perfectly lawful and harms no one, creating victimless crimes, and malum prohibitum laws that reduce freedom.

"(1142, 3)",2.5,"There have been so many school shootings over the last 40 years that researchers have been able to develop a profile of the typical mass murderer.  They're called ""active shooters"" or ""active killers"" and their crimes play out in a matter of minutes.  After the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, police changed their tactics.  The two student gunmen killed 15 people and themselves before the SWAT team was in position.  Commanders realized that it simply takes too long to assemble a tactical team in time to stop an active killer.  The new tactics developed in response to Columbine involved creating an ad-hoc tactical team using the first four or five patrol officers on the scene.  They would enter the shooting scene in a diamond formation with guns pointing in all directions.  This technique was employed by police departments around the country.  Then 32 people were killed by a lone gunman at Virginia Tech in April 2007.  Seung Hui Cho shot 47 people, 30 fatally, in the university's Norris Hall in just 11 minutes.  That means every minute he killed more than three people and shot a total of four.  Once again, the gunman continued shooting until a four-officer team made entry and then he killed himself.  Law enforcement reviewed its tactics.  Based on the Virginia Tech data, experts determined the first officer on scene should make entry immediately with an aggressive attack on the shooter.  Every minute the officer waits for back-up, another three or more people could die.  In other words, while it was once considered suicide for a lone officer to take on an active killer, it is now considered statistical homicide for him not to do so.  Tactical Defense Institute in Adams County, Ohio developed one of the first ""single officer response"" programs in the nation.  TDI was teaching the tactic even before Virginia Tech. Now the National School Resource Officer Organization (NSRO) is using TDI instructors to teach school resource officers how to confront a gunman immediately.  Locally, all Blue Ash police officers are trained in these new tactics in large part because their chief, Col. Chris Wallace, is also a TDI instructor.  The other statistic that emerged from a study of active killers is that they almost exclusively seek out ""gun free"" zones for their attacks.  In most states, concealed handguns are prohibited at schools and on college campuses even for those with permits.  Many malls and workplaces also place signs at their entrances prohibiting firearms on the premises.  Now tacticians believe the signs themselves may be an invitation to the active killers.  The psychological profile of a mass murderer indicates he is looking to inflict the most casualties as quickly as possible.  Also, the data show most active killers have no intention of surviving the event.  They may select schools and shopping malls because of the large number of defenseless victims and the virtual guarantee no on the scene one is armed.  As soon as they're confronted by any armed resistance, the shooters typically turn the gun on themselves.","I believe that explains everything very well. ""Gun free zones"" are nothing more than ""sheep for the slaughter"" and ""wholesale massacre"" locations that violent and murderous individuals flock to."

Fruit flies were exposed to x rays to speed up mutation rates, we have observed the equivalent of millions of years (in terms of human generations) of super-accelerated mutation and.... no new body parts.  Evolutionists will also list in steps how a new body part can arise. This is only plausible if each of those steps could be directly observed. If not, then it is nothing more than science fiction.

The genetic code sure is interesting.

"(223, 3)",2,"Thus, the standard genetic code appears to be a point on an evolutionary trajectory from a random point (code) about half the way to the summit of the local peak. The fitness landscape of code evolution appears to be extremely rugged, containing numerous peaks with a broad distribution of heights, and the standard code is relatively unremarkable, being located on the slope of a moderate-height peak.","Thus showing in that analysis which include all possible codes (not only biosynthetically restricted codes) that the genetic code is partially optimal with regards to error minimization. It should be noted though that analysis only included a subset of the possible optimality feature of the code.  From article 3 The analysis above did not include other nearly optimal features of the genetic code including: A) The actual code is far better than other possible codes in minimizing the number of amino acids incorporated until translation is interrupted after a frameshift error occurred. B) The code is highly optimal for encoding arbitrary additional information, i.e., information other than the amino acid sequence in protein-coding sequences.  Thus, two more features for which the code is close to being optimal. What is interesting about these two optimal features is that they may facilitate evolution i.e. the code is primed for the future by being optimal in allowing future incorporation of additional information.  In article nr.4  The coevolution theory of the origin of the genetic code is discussed. The theory suggests that the genetic code is an imprint of the biosynthetic (biosynthetically restricted) relationships between amino acids.

"(588, 1)",2.333333333,"While Wong [9] highlighted the precursor-product relationships between amino acids and their crucial role in defining the organisation of the genetic code, Miseta [10] clearly identified that the non-amino acid molecules that were precursors of amino acids might have been able to play an important role in organising the genetic code. Miseta [10] suggested the idea of an intimate relationship between molecules, the intermediates of glucose degradation, as precursors of precursor amino acids, and the organisation of the genetic code. This observation is also analysed by Taylor and Coates [11] who showed the relationship between the glycolytic pathway, the citric acid cycle, the biosyntheses of amino acids and the genetic code (Fig. 1) and, in particular, they point out that (i) all the amino acids that are members of a biosynthetic family tend to have codons with the same first base (Fig. 1) and (ii) that the five amino acids codified by GNN codons are found in four biosynthetic pathways close to or at the beginning of the pathway head (Fig. 1)[11]. More recently, Davis [12,13] has provided evidence that tRNAs descending from a common ancestor were adaptors of amino acids synthesised by a common precursor and he also discusses the biosynthetic families of amino acids, suggesting their importance in genetic code origin.","Is it correct to assume that in the presence of the precursors of the standard genetic code (e.g. intermediates of glucose degradation and the citric acid cycle), the intimate relationship between these molecules resulted in the inevitable organization of the genetic code (global optimum of the system)?

The only time ""channel"" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological.

That's what one religious right outfit is suggesting. This week, Morality in Media disseminated a statement noting that the Iowa Supreme Court had legalized gay marriage on the same day that a gunman murdered 13 people in Binghamton, New York. The headline on the release: ""Connecting the Dots: The Line Between Gay Marriage and Mass Murders."" The group's president, Bob Peters, notes that the ""underlying problem is that increasingly we live in a 'post-Christian' society, where Judeo-Christian faith and values have less and less influence."" And, he continues, this ""secular value system is also reflected in the 'sexual revolution,' which is the driving force behind the push for 'gay marriage.'""  Here's the punch line:  It most certainly is not my intention to blame the epidemic of mass murders on the gay rights movement! It is my intention to point out that the success of the sexual revolution is inversely proportional to the decline in morality; and it is the decline of morality (and the faith that so often under girds it) that is the underlying cause of our modern day epidemic of mass murders.   That is, he's not saying that gay rights activists are directly responsible for the murderous actions of gun-toting madmen. But Peters maintains that those who champion gay rights are undermining the moral fiber of society and that this assault on traditional values creates an environment in which killing sprees can more easily occur. These acts of gun violence, he insists, are the poisoned fruit of the push for gay marriage.  Talk about exploiting tragedy to advance an agenda. It might be tempting to dismiss Peters and Morality in Media as marginal, but this group did receive federal funding from 2005 through 2007. The money supported a Morality in Media project, ObscenityCrimes.org, which paid two retired law enforcement officers to review citizen complaints about obscenity on the Internet and to forward the best leads to the US Justice Department for possible prosecution. A total of $300,000 was provided to Morality in Media through two earmarks Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.) placed into spending bills, according to Peters. And a portion of that money went to cover Peters' salary. As The New York Times reported in 2007, no obscenity prosecutions had resulted from the Morality in Media's obscenity-tracking work.  Peters tells me that since 2007 -- thanks to the fuss about earmarks -- he has received no more funds from the US government. After the earmarked grants ran out in 2007, he did apply directly to the Justice Department and was turned down. Since then, he has raised private funds to keep ObscenityCrimes.org going. That may be for the best -- particularly for Morality in Media. Peters has recently attacked President Barack Obama's pick for deputy attorney general, David Ogden, as an ""ACLU-minded"" sort who would ""likely weaken"" government efforts ""to curb sexual trafficking and sexual exploitation of children."" It would be difficult -- or, at least, awkward -- for Peters to blast a Justice Department that was funding his own work.  In his statement on gay marriage and mass murder, Peters notes that Christianity and Judaism teach ""that we are to love our neighbors as ourselves and to forgive others."" But on the subject of gay marriage, he does seem to have a rather unforgiving approach.

"(184, 5)",2,"4. By RUTH FADEN, ANNE DRAPKIN LYERLY and MAGGIE LITTLE WHEN diseases like swine flu hit, pregnant women are especially at risk. And yet we know surprisingly little about how to treat them. In its guidelines for the antiviral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that pregnant women infected or at high risk for infection should take the recommended adult dosage: ""Pregnancy should not be considered a contraindication"" to taking the drugs, because the benefits of treatment ""likely outweigh the theoretical risks of antiviral use.""  But we don't know whether this is true. Concerns about the ethics of performing drug studies on pregnant women mean we know far less about how to treat them. It is perfectly possible that the standard adult dose of antivirals will not work in the pregnant body.  Pregnancy acts as a wild card when it comes to medication. Changes in blood flow, digestion, kidney function and enzymatic activity alter the ways that drugs act on the body. There is almost no data on how antivirals function during pregnancy, and the same is true for many other drugs on the market.  The consequences are potentially profound. One of the antibiotics used for treating exposure to anthrax is metabolized so quickly by the pregnant body that no dose, no matter how large, is likely to be effective. If the threat of widespread anthrax attacks after 9/11 had been realized, pregnant women and their babies would have faced disastrous consequences. We should not make the same mistake in planning for the possible reemergence of swine flu in the fall.  One pregnant woman in America has already died from the flu. Although other health problems complicated her illness, her death is a reminder that we need to understand how to medicate mothers-to-be. Research should be done now, while pregnant women are already taking antivirals. Studying blood samples from as few as two dozen women would get us a long way toward determining whether the standard dose is effective.","Wouldn't it be wonderful if, in this male-centered world, drugs were designed to be women-friendly, especially pregnant women-friendly?"
"(487, 6)",2.8,"5, By L. LEWIS WALL MOTHERHOOD is a blessing, but in many parts of the world childbirth leaves women permanently injured and turns them into social outcasts.  In West Africa, only about 1 percent of pregnant women have Caesarean deliveries because the procedure isn't widely available. When labor is obstructed, the baby is trapped in the pelvis, and labor can last up to a week.  Women who survive this ordeal can develop a hole in the bladder called a fistula. This injury - caused by the prolonged pressure of the baby's head on the soft tissues of the pelvis - causes continuous and uncontrollable loss of urine. The millions of women in Africa and Asia who suffer from fistulas are often shunned by their communities for the rest of their lives.  In Liberia, I operated on a woman who had endured a fistula for 35 years, and it took only 20 minutes to repair her injury. Including a month of hospital care and the surgical supplies needed, the operation costs about $300 to $450. All a clinic needs is spinal anesthesia, intravenous fluids, basic surgical instruments, sutures and a catheter for draining urine.  It's even easier to prevent these injuries from happening in the first place. With supervision, local village ""labor monitors"" can learn to track the progress of a birth and send the woman to a hospital when labor lasts too long. Trained birth attendants can detect abnormalities in labor by using a partograph - a simple graph that charts the progress of labor and tells attendants when to intervene.  The World Health Organization tested the partograph in 35,000 births in Southeast Asia and found that using it cut the number of prolonged labors almost by half. Widespread use of this simple early warning system would go a long way toward saving babies' and mothers' lives - and making fistulas a thing of the past.","Wouldn't it be wonderful if every woman in the world had access to decent prenatal care, if every woman in the world could be guanateed safe childbirth, wouldn't it be wonderful?

"(1102, 4)",1,"A. Guns save more lives than they take; prevent more injuries than they inflict   * Guns used 2.5 million times a year in self-defense. Law-abiding citizens use guns to defend themselves against criminals as many as 2.5 million times every year -- or about 6,850 times a day.1 This means that each year, firearms are used more than 80 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives.2  * Of the 2.5 million times citizens use their guns to defend themselves every year, the overwhelming majority merely brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off their attackers. Less than 8% of the time, a citizen will kill or wound his/her attacker.3  * As many as 200,000 women use a gun every year to defend themselves against sexual abuse.4  * Even anti-gun Clinton researchers concede that guns are used 1.5 million times annually for self-defense. According to the Clinton Justice Department, there are as many as 1.5 million cases of self-defense every year. The National Institute of Justice published this figure in 1997 as part of ""Guns in America"" -- a study which was authored by noted anti-gun criminologists Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig.5  * Armed citizens kill more crooks than do the police. Citizens shoot and kill at least twice as many criminals as police do every year (1,527 to 606).6 And readers of Newsweek learned that ""only 2 percent of civilian shootings involved an innocent person mistakenly identified as a criminal. The 'error rate' for the police, however, was 11 percent, more than five times as high.""7  * Handguns are the weapon of choice for self-defense. Citizens use handguns to protect themselves over 1.9 million times a year.8 Many of these self-defense handguns could be labeled as ""Saturday Night Specials.""  B. Concealed carry laws help reduce crime  * Nationwide: one-half million self-defense uses. Every year, as many as one-half million citizens defend themselves with a firearm away from home.9  * Concealed carry laws are dropping crime rates across the country. A comprehensive national study determined in 1996 that violent crime fell after states made it legal to carry concealed firearms. The results of the study showed:  * States which passed concealed carry laws reduced their murder rate by 8.5%, rapes by 5%, aggravated assaults by 7% and robbery by 3%;10 and  * If those states not having concealed carry laws had adopted such laws in 1992, then approximately 1,570 murders, 4,177 rapes, 60,000 aggravated assaults and over 11,000 robberies would have been avoided yearly.11  * Vermont: one of the safest five states in the country. In Vermont, citizens can carry a firearm without getting permission... without paying a fee... or without going through any kind of government-imposed waiting period. And yet for ten years in a row, Vermont has remained one of the top-five, safest states in the union -- having three times received the ""Safest State Award.""12  * Florida: concealed carry helps slash the murder rates in the state. In the fifteen years following the passage of Florida's concealed carry law in 1987, over 800,000 permits to carry firearms were issued to people in the state.13 FBI reports show that the homicide rate in Florida, which in 1987 was much higher than the national average, fell 52% during that 15-year period -- thus putting the Florida rate below the national average. 14  * Do firearms carry laws result in chaos? No. Consider the case of Florida. A citizen in the Sunshine State is far more likely to be attacked by an alligator than to be assaulted by a concealed carry holder.  1. During the first fifteen years that the Florida law was in effect, alligator attacks outpaced the number of crimes committed by carry holders by a 229 to 155 margin.  2. And even the 155 ""crimes"" committed by concealed carry permit holders are somewhat misleading as most of these infractions resulted from Floridians who accidentally carried their firearms into restricted areas, such as an airport.15  C. Criminals avoid armed citizens   * Kennesaw, GA. In 1982, this suburb of Atlanta passed a law requiring heads of households to keep at least one firearm in the house. The residential burglary rate subsequently dropped 89% in Kennesaw, compared to the modest 10.4% drop in Georgia as a whole.16  * Ten years later (1991), the residential burglary rate in Kennesaw was still 72% lower than it had been in 1981, before the law was passed.17  * Nationwide. Statistical comparisons with other countries show that burglars in the United States are far less apt to enter an occupied home than their foreign counterparts who live in countries where fewer civilians own firearms. Consider the following rates showing how often a homeowner is present when a burglar strikes:  * Homeowner occupancy rate in the gun control countries of Great Britain, Canada and Netherlands: 45% (average of the three countries); and,  * Homeowner occupancy rate in the United States: 12.7%.18  Rapes averted when women carry or use firearms for protection  * Orlando, FL. In 1966-67, the media highly publicized a safety course which taught Orlando women how to use guns. The result: Orlando's rape rate dropped 88% in 1967, whereas the rape rate remained constant in the rest of Florida and the nation.19  * Nationwide. In 1979, the Carter Justice Department found that of more than 32,000 attempted rapes, 32% were actually committed. But when a woman was armed with a gun or knife, only 3% of the attempted rapes were actually successful.20  Justice Department study:  * 3/5 of felons polled agreed that ""a criminal is not going to mess around with a victim he knows is armed with a gun.""21  * 74% of felons polled agreed that ""one reason burglars avoid houses when people are at home is that they fear being shot during the crime.""22  * 57% of felons polled agreed that ""criminals are more worried about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police.""23   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz, ""Armed Resistance to Crime: The Prevalence and Nature of Self-Defense With a Gun,"" 86 The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, Northwestern University School of Law, 1 (Fall 1995):164.  Dr. Kleck is a professor in the school of criminology and criminal justice at Florida State University in Tallahassee. He has researched extensively and published several essays on the gun control issue. His book, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America, has become a widely cited source in the gun control debate. In fact, this book earned Dr. Kleck the prestigious American Society of Criminology Michael J. Hindelang award for 1993. This award is given for the book published in the past two to three years that makes the most outstanding contribution to criminology.  Even those who don't like the conclusions Dr. Kleck reaches, cannot argue with his impeccable research and methodology. In ""A Tribute to a View I Have Opposed,"" Marvin E. Wolfgang writes that, ""What troubles me is the article by Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz. The reason I am troubled is that they have provided an almost clear-cut case of methodologically sound research in support of something I have theoretically opposed for years, namely, the use of a gun in defense against a criminal perpetrator.... I have to admit my admiration for the care and caution expressed in this article and this research. Can it be true that about two million instances occur each year in which a gun was used as a defensive measure against crime? It is hard to believe. Yet, it is hard to challenge the data collected. We do not have contrary evidence."" Wolfgang, ""A Tribute to a View I Have Opposed,"" The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, at 188.  Wolfgang says there is no ""contrary evidence."" Indeed, there are more than a dozen national polls -- one of which was conducted by The Los Angeles Times -- that have found figures comparable to the Kleck-Gertz study. Even the Clinton Justice Department (through the National Institute of Justice) found there were as many as 1.5 million defensive users of firearms every year. See National Institute of Justice, ""Guns in America: National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms,"" Research in Brief (May 1997).  As for Dr. Kleck, readers of his materials may be interested to know that he is a member of the ACLU, Amnesty International USA, and Common Cause. He is not and has never been a member of or contributor to any advocacy group on either side of the gun control debate.  2 According to the National Safety Council, the total number of gun deaths (by accidents, suicides and homicides) account for less than 30,000 deaths per year. See Injury Facts, published yearly by the National Safety Council, Itasca, Illinois.  3Kleck and Gertz, ""Armed Resistance to Crime,"" at 173, 185.  4Kleck and Gertz, ""Armed Resistance to Crime,"" at 185.  5 Philip J.

The finding of 1.5 million yearly self-defense cases did not sit well with the anti-gun bias of the study's authors, who attempted to explain why there could not possibly be one and a half million cases of self-defense every year.

"(1352, 6)",1,"If one agrees to a discussion without using the Bible as some people insist, then they have set the terms of the debate. In essence these terms are:  1. 'Facts' are neutral. However, there are no such things as 'brute facts'; all facts are interpreted. Once the Bible is eliminated in the argument, then the Christians' presuppositions are gone, leaving them unable to effectively give an alternate interpretation of the facts. Their opponents then have the upper hand as they still have their presuppositions - see Naturalism, logic and reality.","This is where intuitive, ready agreement with the opening paragraph starts to get the reader into trouble. All facts are interpreted according to presuppositions, so it's only fair that Creationists should get to bring their presuppositions to the table just like everyone else, right?  Well, let's apply that same blanket reasoning to other situations and see what happens. Imagine a juror whose personal prejudices lead him to presuppose the guilt of a defendant based on her skin colour, and to interpret the facts of the case accordingly. Should he be allowed to sit in judgement? Of course not - but according to the reasoning presented by AiG that leaves us in an impossible position: by eliminating those jurors predisposed to return a guilty verdict based upon race, we necessarily cede the court to those predisposed to return an innocent verdict based upon race.  Our intuition rightly rebels at this false dichotomy. We readily apprehend the existence of a middle ground wherein skin colour confers neither automatic guilt nor automatic innocence. Ah, but! Is that neutrality itself not merely another presupposition, another axiom through which the facts are being interpreted? One might protest that it is not, that the irrelevance of skin colour as a determinant of guilt can be determined empirically. But it would be in vain, because there are, after all, no such thing as 'brute facts'. The data you supply to justify your position only do so when interpreted according to your presupposition that guilt can be race-agnostic. To someone whose presupposition is otherwise, your 'facts' mean something quite different - they might for instance mean the research itself must be corrupt and biased, or at least faulty in some unknown way.  In short, following Ken Ham's reasoning we find ourselves deep in a rabbit hole with no end in sight. We can venture to justify no opinion or belief, because the facts that appear to support one may upon the least whim be reinterpreted in the light of another. I may if I so choose presuppose the bible to be the work of the devil himself, and I am not to be chastised nor deterred through argument, for the axioms by which I choose to interpret the world are, in Ken's eyes, inviolate.  This is hardly the result Ken could have intended. What's gone wrong? Why has his fair-minded attempt to level the playing field backfired so badly?  The answer, of course, is that the playing field isn't really level.  Every once in a while someone will decide that he can fly, and attempt to demonstrate this facility to the world by leaping from a high place. The world thus far has remained largely unimpressed. This is an extreme example of what can happen when the axioms one uses to interpret the world conflict with those upon which it really operates, and it provides the first key to unlocking our dilemma:  Good axioms yield accurate predictions.  As Ken rightly observed, known facts are always subject to interpretation. But the reverse process, the prediction of facts yet to come based on a formulated theory, is not. In making a prediction we are forced to stop shoehorning data into our preconceived worldview and make a statement about what we will find. This yields the closest thing we have to a truly objective measurement of congruence between theory and reality.  This understanding allows us to validate or repudiate the presuppositions we bring to bear on the facts at our disposal. The racist juror would from the outset predict the evidence to be presented would turn out to be stacked against the defendant, but his low 'hit rate' would invalidate his axiom.  So, part of what distinguishes Creationism from mainstream scientific understanding is that, in hindsight and on an ongoing basis its predictions fall wide of the mark. The discovery of shared pseudogenes should have been all but impossible, as should identically located retroviral insertions. We should not have found fossils at all, let alone a nested hierarchy of forms. We should not have been able to observe evolution and speciation. We should not have been able to see very distant stars and galaxies.  All of these unexpected face-plants for Creationism have of course been rationalised away after the fact. Shared pseudogenes must all have some function we don't know about; there must be some determinism in the location of ERVs; fossils and the geological column were all laid down in the Great Flood; the speed of light and the rate of decay of radioactive materials were different in the past. But these rationalisations entail further predictions: we ought not to be able to safely remove pseudogenes if they are functional - but we can. If ERV insertion is deterministic we should see that in the lab - but we don't. If fossils were laid down by the flood we wouldn't expect similar animals to be sorted by depth according to the number of cusps on a back tooth, or to be buried in amongst consistent strata of pollen grains, and we wouldn't expect there to be anything like as much limestone. If decay rates had been high enough in the past to explain what we see today in just 10,000 years, we ought to now be breathing incandescent rock vapour instead of air. And so on.  Science also changes to accommodate the unexpected - but as often as not the 'unexpected' has been discovered by scientists extrapolating existing theories to their logical conclusions, predicting something we didn't initially suspect but which has later been confirmed. And that's the bottom line: Creationism and science both evolve as new facts emerge, but while the result for science has been a trend towards better and more accurate predictions, indicative of closing the gap between theory and reality, Creationism remains a tumbling snowball of post-hoc rationalisation growing around a hard core of sacred axioms that - it would certainly appear thus far - make it impossible for the convergence of prediction and reality to occur."

First, a simple model of random stepwise addition of physicochemically similar amino acids to the code is demonstrated to result in substantial error minimization. Second, a model of random addition of physicochemically similar amino acids in a codon expansion scheme derived from the Ambiguity Reduction Model results in improved error minimization over the first model. Finally, a recently introduced 213 Model of genetic code evolution is examined by the random addition of physicochemically similar amino acids to a primordial core of four amino acids. Under certain conditions, 22% of the resulting codes produced according to the latter model possess equivalent or superior error minimization to the standard genetic code. These analyses demonstrate that a substantial proportion of error minimization is likely to have arisen neutrally, simply as a consequence of code expansion, facilitated by duplication of the genes encoding adaptor molecules and charging enzymes.

They basically expanded the meaning of the Lautenberg Amendment, which is a big NO NO! I think that is what Justice Roberts was saying in his dissent.  Quote Justice Roberts dissent:  That reading does not require the specified domestic relationship in clause (ii) to be an element of the predicate misdemeanor statute. Individuals convicted under generic use-of-force statutes containing no reference to domestic violence would there-fore be subject to prosecution under Â§922(g)(9).  ....  The majority also points out that interpreting ""commit-ted by"" to modify the ""use"" of force would render the word""committed"" superfluous. That may be so, but as shown, reading ""committed by"" to modify ""offense"" has its own flaws. All this goes to show that the statute is not an example of elegant syntax under either reading.

''It has been objected also against a bill of rights, that, by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power, it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration; and it might follow by implication, that those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government, and were consequently insecure. This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system; but, I conceive, that it may be guarded against. I have attempted it, as gentlemen may see by turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution.'' 2 It is clear from its text and from Madison's statement that the Amendment states but a rule of construction, making clear that a Bill of Rights might not by implication be taken to increase the powers of the national government in areas not enumerated, and that it does not contain within itself any guarantee of a right or a proscription of an infringement. 3 Recently, however, the Amendment has been construed to be positive affirmation of the existence of rights which are not enumerated but which are nonetheless protected by other provisions.",The purpose of the Bill of Rights.Preamble to the Bill of Rights.

Those who bear children as adolescents suffer higher maternal mortality and morbidity rates, and their children are more likely to die in infancy. One reliable way to solve this problem is through education. The more affordable it is, the longer girls will stay in school and delay pregnancy.  I advise a nonprofit foundation called Innovation for Poverty Action that focuses on keeping girls in school. (We aren't alone; lots of other terrific organizations do this, too.) In a pilot program we ran in Kenya a few years ago, around 5,000 sixth-grade girls in 163 primary schools were given a $6 school uniform free. If they stayed in school, they received a second uniform after 18 months. The dropout rate over the next three years decreased by a third, to 12 percent, and the pregnancy rate fell to 8 percent from 12 percent. Of every 50 girls given free uniforms, then, three stayed in school as a result of the uniforms alone, and two delayed pregnancy.  The benefits of secondary education are even greater. In the same group of Kenyan girls, 50 percent of those who dropped out after primary school had a child within two years, but only 8 percent who went on to secondary school became pregnant in that same period.","Wouldn't it be wonderful if every girl and every woman were valued enough to educate, to make sure that girls do not become pregnant before their bodies are ready for the traumatic event of pregnancy and chilldbirth?"

By HELEN EPSTEINEVEN as the United States Agency for International Development sends hundreds of millions of dollars worth of food to developing countries, a strange but important nutritional problem is being overlooked: The children of women who suffer from severe stress and poverty sometimes seem to give up and refuse to eat. Studies suggest that this stems from maternal detachment Ã‚â€” the breakdown of emotional connection between traumatized mothers and their children...... Sally Grantham-McGregor, a child health researcher working in Jamaica, demonstrated that teaching poor mothers the basic techniques of mothering Ã‚â€” holding and playing, and communicating with smiles, gestures and questions Ã‚â€” could help their ailing children achieve remarkable developmental gains. And these gains were much greater than those that could have been achieved with food and medical care alone.Today, Unicef and the World Health Organization agree that counseling should be an important part of food aid programs. Once feeding programs are in place, it costs very little to train community health workers. One organization, Play Therapy Africa, which runs feeding and counseling centers in Ethiopia, is training aid workers in these methods in 50 centers. The one-time expense of $278,000 Ã‚â€” the cost of training and monitoring the health workers Ã‚â€” is a pittance compared with the millions of dollars spent on food alone.Unfortunately, most aid economists overlook counseling. When the journal Lancet recently reviewed strategies to reduce malnutrition, these methods werenÃ‚â€™t mentioned at all.Vulnerable children require more than food and medicine; they need affection.

"(513, 4)",0.333333333,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A U.S. judge Thursday became the second in the nation to rule that a federal ban on a particular type of late-term abortion is unconstitutional.  In his ruling on the law dubbed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, Judge Richard Conway Casey cited a high court ruling and a lack of exemption to protect the health of a woman.  ""The Supreme Court ... informed us that this gruesome procedure may be outlawed only if there exists in medical consensus that there is no circumstance in which any woman could potentially benefit from it,"" Casey wrote in his ruling.  ""A division of medical opinion exists,"" Casey wrote. ""Such a division means that the constitution requires a health exception.""  The plaintiffs in the suit -- seven physicians who perform abortions and the National Abortion Federation -- were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union.  ""We're quite pleased that the court recognized that this ban brought an attack on second-trimester abortions as early as 13 weeks in pregnancy,"" Lorraine Kenny, a spokeswoman for the ACLU, told CNN.  The ban included no health exception and therefore would endanger women's health, Kenny said.  Planned Parenthood also applauded the decision.  ""The abortion ban is a brazen affront to women's health, the right to medical privacy and the U.S. Constitution and was rightfully struck down,"" Planned Parenthood President Gloria Feldt said in a statement released by the group.  ""This ruling is a critical step toward ensuring that women and doctors -- not politicians -- can make private, personal health care decisions,"" Feldt added.  The National Right to Life Committee came out against the judge's decision.  ""Judge Casey said his ruling was dictated by a 5 to 4 Supreme Court ruling in 2000, which held that Roe v. Wade protects partial-birth abortion,"" said Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the NRLC, in a statement.  ""Future appointments to the Supreme Court will determine whether it remains legal to mostly deliver living premature infants and painfully puncture their skulls,"" he said.  Penalties and procedures A federal judge in San Francisco previously ruled the act unconstitutional, and a U.S. court in Nebraska is to rule on another case by August 31.  The law would have imposed criminal and civil penalties on ""[a]ny physician who, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion.""  The law affects abortions carried out late in the typical 40-week pregnancy, but before the fetus is considered viable.  Such primarily second-trimester abortions usually involve a procedure known to doctors as ""dilation and extraction,"" but referred to by opponents as ""partial-birth abortion.""  During the procedure, the fetus is partially removed and its skull collapsed.  Most medical organizations opposed the law.  In the San Francisco ruling, Judge Phyllis Hamilton wrote that the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology expressed the belief that there are circumstances in which partial-birth abortion ""may be the most appropriate and safest procedure to save the life or health of a woman.""  The federal government contends that it is never necessary, refuting the Supreme Court's rejection of a Nebraska law in a 2000 decision.  Since 1995, state bans against late-term abortions have been enacted in more than half the states. They have been challenged in courts throughout the country.  The ACLU says courts considering these laws -- including the U.S. Supreme Court just three years ago -- have consistently struck down the bans because they do not take into account risks to the woman's health.",Just to add more fuel on the fire :P.

"(1204, 6)",0.666666667,"As I see it the problem in this country is not guns. The problem is that our society has gotten soft on crime and pretty much gotten to the point of ""no one is responsible for their own behavior"".   Take the law suits against the gun manufacturer's. Colt comes to mind. Someone used a Colt firearm in a murder and the victim's family sued Colt for the wrongful death of a family member. The court's basically said that colt should have known that their products may have been used in a crime and not sold them to someone who could have used it in the commision of a crime. That being the case, why can't the auto manufacturer's be sued when one of their vehicles is used in the commision of a crime? Why can't Ford or Chevy be sued when one of their vehicles is used in a DUI vehicular homicide? The reasoning I have read is that the auto maker's are unable to control the end use of their products. So how can one manufacturer be held responsible for the end use of their product and not another?  Another case in point. Less than a hundred years ago, if you were convicted of a murder you were sentenced to death and the sentence was carried out. Now if you murder somebody, you can plea bargain it down to involuntary manslaughter, get sentenced to 18 to 23 months, and be paroled in 9 to 12 month's on good behavior. Now some would say the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment. To them I put this question. What do you call kidnapping a child from her bedroom, raping and sodomizing her, putting her on a hot engine block, then strangling her. Don't know about the rest of society, but that qualifies as cruel and unusual punishment in my book. By the way, the guy that did this was sentenced to life in prison on the taxpayer's dime.  No longer does the punishment fit the crime in this country. We have put a price tag on human life and I must say it is a damn cheap one. Guns are not the problem in this country. The problem is a government who trying to erode our rights to further their own agenda.  Now for those who say we have a police force to protect us, if you would actually read their purpose, you would see that the police force has no duty to protect the individual, only the public in general. I have quite a few friends at the local state police barracks and in general they are opposed to gun control. Most police organization who are for gun control who are for gun control are politically motivated.  For those who are going to say I'm a right wing nut job, I'll give you this. I served my country in various special operations forces. I can not go into anymore more detail than i'll give you here, so please don't ask. Automatic weapons were designed for assualt purposes so I will give you that one. However, as a highly decorated combat veteran I will say this. The most dangerous and demoralizing weapon ever made was a sniper rifle. Death can come from anywhere at anytime. Most have an effective range well over any automatic weapon. Sniper rifles are basically modified hunting rifles that can be duplicated by any gunsmith worth his salt. The effective range on a 5.56mm round ( basically a .223 remington) fired from an M-16 (or An AR-15) is just over 450 meters. A 7.62 x 54 mm round (a .308, a very popular hunting round) is about 1200 meters. To put this in perspective there is just over 1700 meters in a mile.  I do carry a M1911 Colt .45 as a concealed carry weapon. After reading some of the other posts here, I must say I am deeply offended by someone saying that because I carry a CCW I'm going to shoot someone over a fender bender. I will say that their are some who shouldn't be carrying a CCW. And I do take responsibilty for my weapons. Unfortunately. I have had to use my weapon on a couple of occasions. Most of the time simply brandishing the weapon and taking control of the situation is enough to end it in a positive way. Only once have I had to discharge my weapon in self defense. By the way, the criminal in on the receiving end of that one had a very long and violent criminal history.  I have shed the same blood in the same mud as alot of others to insure that EVERYONE in this country has the freedom to have their own opinions about things. That is a right guarenteed in The Constitution of the United States. Just as it is a right for me to own arms of my choice. Some would say that my RKBA is outdated. To them I ask, what if I think your right to free speech or freedom to religion is outdated? Should it be changed too?  There are no easy solutions to the problem we as a society are facing. But blaming guns or free speech for our problems is like saying flies cause garbage. It is easy to blame guns for our problems. But they are merely a tool, like a shovel, that unless put into use by a person or persons. it merely just sits there and does nothing. Our society has pushed the issue of not being responsible or held accoutable for your actions way to far. I do have a solution to these problems, but most would find it offensive. What the hell, I've probably offended alot already, so here goes. We have a three time loser law, that if you have three felony convictions you are considered a career criminal. Now alot of those crimes involve firearms. So if you are convicted of three felony firearms crimes, you should get the death penalty to be carried out immediately. It will take some time to get the message across but iI do believe when the message gets out, firearms crimes will be reduced drastically.  Well, I need to get some things done so I'll write more later.   Later all......","I think you hit it pretty much on the money. Gun control does not cure anger, hate, and violence.  Talk about responsibility. Gun grabbers blame you and me and our behavior for the violence in this country. They blame everyone except the one who pulls the trigger and takes human life."

Bats, for example, are mammals who cannot maintain a constant body temperature and cool off when they are not active. Echidnas maintain a range of body temperatures which usually lies between 77 and 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit and have difficulty cooling down. Mole Rats are another group of mammals who are unable to regulate their body temperature, however, since they live underground, the temperature of their environment does not change much. Some warm-blooded animals, such as bears, groundhogs, gophers and bats hibernate during the cold winter. During hibernation these animals live off of stored body fat and can drop their body temperatures by as much as 50 degrees Fahrenheit. The Hawk Moth is an insect which can raise its body temperature well above the temperature of its surroundings when it is flying because of its huge wing muscles which generate heat when in use. Bees are another example of insects that can raise their body temperatures above that of their environment by moving their wings rapidly to generate heat.",More discussion: http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/dinosaurs/anatomy/Blood.shtml.

Explain.,"I think Carlene is referring more to the 'implanting a fertile embryo/zygote into the uterus' IVF version rather than just using donated sperm cells. So essentially the various healthy sperm are selected and incubated with healthy eggs (so you have selected them to avoid a birth defect, or because most of the eggs are unviable and you are using a donor one), a selection of viable embryos are then given the chance to implant themselves in the woman's uterus.  The process involves a lot of zygotes being created, many of which will be unviable and a lot may have been able to develop properly but seeing as usually only one will implant they end up wasted. I can see pro-lifers objecting to the slightly wasteful technique (with some just discarded and not even given the chance to develop) but I think in this situation you can't really complain about the ones which didn't implant - seeing as this happens often enough in normal people, and may have been the reason the couple went after IVF in the first place.

"(325, 3)",-0.333333333,"The latter, of course. I'm not anti-marriage. In fact I've been ""institutionalized"" with the same woman for 26 great years so far. I just don't see the benefits to society for promoting gay marriage. All I see are increased chances for abuse of the law, additional costs and a promotion of a lifestyle that I , personally, believe is deviant. (not deviant as in ""sinister"", but in the sense of ""abnormal"") But that's not to say that I'm closed minded and can't be persuaded otherwise. There are other things that I consider deviant, but can tolerate, none-the-less.","Well, it may surprise you that I believe that it is deviant to believe that same-sex marriage is immoral (in the sense that it is abnormal). This is because I believe that it is normal for most people to want to treat others the way they wish to be treated themselves. I believe it is normal for others to work toward the happiness of others, especially when that happiness does not interfere with their own happiness. But it does not follow for me that one can oppose same-sex marriage and follow those rules. It seems to me that people have been told or told themselves that same-sex marriage is bad for so long that they have sort of convinced themselves to deviate from human compassion on this one issue. Well, I suppose what I just said doesn't really mean much of anything, just that someone who want to spend his or her life with the one he or she loves does not qualify as ""deviant"" behavior in my book. It is not something that must be ""tolerated"", it is something that should be enjoyed for the good present in its nature.  You wrote that you do not see the benefits of same-sex marriage. I know I went into the benefits of allowing same-sex couples to adopt, but I also spoke on same-sex marriage promoting equality, freedom, and happiness. Let me expand on that.  Equality seems very simple to explain. Currently those who love someone of the opposite sex and choose to enter a relationship with that person are granted a set of benefits under the law. This same set of benefits could be extended to those who love someone of the same sex, but it is not, and they are still forced to pay any costs in taxes that salary cuts from businesses that might be accrued through these benefits being bestowed upon someone else. This simple fact violates equality, and I think this is clear and easy to understand. What may not be clear is why equality is so imporant. Granting a set of rights to one group of people that another does not have elevate the first group over the second. The more equality is removed, the more one group is elevated over the other and the more that first group is leeching off of the second group. If the first group could provide those same bonuses to the second group without causing any real harm, the first group is obligated to do so. For the powerful to take things for themselves that they could just as easily share with the weak crosses the line of moral evil.  Freedom might be a bit more difficult to understand. Though the government is not granting the same set of benefits that it gives opposite-sex couples to same-sex couples, it is not actually taking any anyone's freedom to behave in the manner they please. Or is it? By benefiting one lifestyle over another, the government is directly promoting that specific lifestyle. Taken to the extreme, the government could just as easily imprision those who don't live the way the government commands and claim that those people have complete freedom, they just don't have the ""benefit"" of walking around that other people get. The lack of these benefits could be considered a fine for not living the way the government intends, or more accurately, the government is promoting one lifestyle over another. To any extent which the government does this, we all lose a bit of freedom to behave in the manner that we want. Of course there are good reasons to restrict freedom, taking into consideration murder and stealing, however those are actions that cause harm to people; they are restricted to protect the rights of others, to stop harm. I do not think that any of the reasons you listed are harms that opposite-sex marriage does not also imply, and I think most of the harms you listed are not really harms at all as explained above. In fact, same-sex marriage brings plenty of benefits (again, as I explained above). This in no way warrants the restriction of freedom.  Finally I come to happiness: this is the end of all governments. Governments exist to make as many of their citizens as happy as possible, or at least give them all as much an opportunity to persue happiness as they can. The ideas of freedom and equality are really only a means to help people achieve happiness, to help the achieve the best standard of living they can, to help them be able to do the things in life they want to do, to help people in any way they can. With same-sex marriage, we have the opportunity to help a set of people without bringing harm to anyone. We have the power to give the same rights that we hold to a group of people different from ourselves. We have an opportunity to help people, and I am forced to conclude that we cannot call ourselves equal, we cannot call ourselves the land of the free, and we cannot call ourselves a morally good society if we do not take that opportunity."

To support creation you must first tackle the concept of something ""outside"" the knowable universe. Because this is irrational, the entire concept of creation is irrational to ""believe"" in.  You can believe in it, but you must accept that the belief is not a rational belief.  ================================================= The theory of evolution as it applies to life on earth: Essentially that the various living things on the earth are a product of purely physical/natural laws, which can be rationally explained.  There is nothing inherently irrational about the theory of evolution being used to explain life in the physical unviverse, yet creation begins with an irrational premise, that we can ""know"" about the ""unknowable"". It can certainly be a false theory, however, you can rationally show that it is or is not (to the degree determined by your evidence). ================================================  You cannot begin to hold a rational debate about the unknowable. It is not a rational alternative to the theory of evolution, unless you can somehow show that you aren't relying on the unknowable. I think many topcis in this forum are good debate topcis, philosophy, politics, health care, environment, entertainment, fun, etc. This topic, like a few other noteworthy topics, requires one side to abandon reason for faith, an irrational position, as premise.   Keep in mind two important points: 1. Reason does not imply truth, it's a method of seperating truth from what is false, and you can quite easily (and do every day), reason something to a false conclusion. There is nothing knowable that is beyond the reach of reason, this is why for someone to claim faith is somehow possible WITH reason, one has to try and show that reason is somehow insufficient for the acquisition of knowledge, which it isn't. (see other thread http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=3329)  2. You can believe whatever you like, and it can certainly impact your life (faith), however it cannot be said that faith is based on rational belief, or takes part in reason, in any way, it is the opposite of reason. Reason requires evidence, faith does not, they cannot be intermixed.

"(396, 6)",-1,"i think its finally settled that physical (testable or tangible) evidence of God can never be found. this is not only because of its elusive nature to science, but also because of religious requirements.  from a scientic perspective, nothing ever occurs outside of the realm of phyical law. that is, physical laws are constant and unbreakable, and there is nothing new or unpredictable or inexplicable about them. because the laws of physics completely govern ever aspect of the universe, there is nothing left for a supernatural being to do, at least where the phsical realm is concerned. there is no supernatural phenomenon, and no occurance that natural physical laws do not affect  from a religious perspective, knowledge of God can only come through faith. we already know that faith is certainty in the absence of rational evidence, in other word believing without evidence. Hebrews 11:6 says ""And without faith it is impossible to please him. For whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him."" faith is the key to religion, and only through faith can religion be established. therefore, if some physical observation could verify God's existence, then it would contradict what religion says about God. this is a real catch 22. you search for evidence to solidify your faith, but if evidence comes you dont need faith, and without faith you cannot relate to God  in all, as far as i'm concrned, it is totally futile to seek rational proof of God's existence. even if it was found, it wouldnt be found. i remember saying that it is possible to prove that God exists; that is, in the event that God showed up and said ""hey, it's Me!"". but even this can never happen, because such a scenario would contradict the bible, and thus not prove God exists as far as the bible is concerned.  and when all is said and done, it still doesnt answer the question ""does God exist?"".","But then it also doesn't answer the question ""does anything exist"", nor does it answer an infinite number of ""existence"" questions. Do ""trolls"" exist, follows the same reasoning. If you find one, they are no longer a fairy tale/imaginary creature, they are some organic life form that can be measured, tested, and quantified..i.e. no longer an imaginary creature. So they can no more be found than god.  So replace god/troll with an infinite number of other imaginary things and you'll see why the question ""Does god exist?"", has no real importance in the physical universe. (does the tooth fairy exist, does a unicorn exist, do flying pigs exist, etc.)  In fact, I like that statement. The existence of god is not imporant...  Rather - the FAITH in god(s, etc.) is what is ""important"", and the thoughts most certainly exist in the physical world and have a measureable impact.   I think that's why I don't mind so much ""religion"" per se, it's the human condition that brings suffering, and uncertainty, into our lives and for some people, the feelings brought about by their faith seems to treat the condition. (the human condition also brings joy, love, etc., but I'd like that without the pain personally)  I only mind it when things in the physical universe are ""attacked"" with the premise of belief in god(s), which is a waste of human energy...we have a limited time, don't spend it using fallacy to undermine those who are actually trying to build on the foundation of human knowledge. And any belief in something without evidence scares me if it becomes a driving force behind decisions.  ...she's a witch because she MADE the crops die...she must be burned.   ...he broke ""god's"" law and therefore must be guilty..  ...this is ""god's"" war..  Yeah, that still scares me. That's why I think, at least in the US, the seperation of church and state is so ridiculously important, and accepted. While there are fundamentalists that rail against it...it's hopefully obvious that with ~80% of the US believing in an imaginary ""god"", but also having a separation of church and state and the most generally advanced scienctific community in the world, then the two can obviously co-exist, and I'd go so far as to say thrive as long as the line is drawn and not crossed.

At approximately 200 kya there was a second migration of hominids out of Africa. This time it was fully modern H. sapiens, which proceeded to replace whatever populations that then occupied Asia and Europe. Some see direct competition and extermination of the native populations, some see passive replacement due to better adaptive strategies, and some see genetic admixture with the preponderance of genetic material coming from the incoming human populations, eventually replacing and assimilating them into the greater collective.

You have entered into this debate supposedly to demonstrate with logic, reasoning, and measureable evidence that the theory of evolution is the truth. But these statements do not support the theory of evolution. You are merely appealing to the authority of the scientific and academic community, and seeking to intimidate and bash the opposition into silence. This will not sponsor intellectual discussion and debate.","Just as you have a background in science Frog, I also have an extensive background in Christianity. A brief synopsis: starting at birth I was without consent given the supposed ""gift"" of Catholic faith. In highschool I met a kid and later on a girlfirend who were both Born Again Christians. I thought I'd dabble in it. The girlfirend and I went our seperate ways, but I remained a Christian and began studying the Bible. The transformations in me were mostly bad and far beyond the scope of this (we can discuss it on a different forum), but one important thing occured when I began studying the Bible in earnest. I found holes and flaws too big to be ignored. Don't ask me what they were because, again, this is not the religious forum and I'd be hard pressed to even tell you what they were, but I assure you there was a time I could quote them chapter and verse. Since that time I have tried my best to forget it. I realized that my error was the attempt to literally interpret the Bible. I knew that if I pulled back from that, attempting instead to decipher the good message of the scriptures, I could perhaps save my Christian faith. But I didn't want to become an apologist. So, in my mind I travelled east. I dabbled in Taoism and Buddhism which appealed very much to my love of Asian history. After a year or two of this, when I discovered there was also a strict theology behind these Asian religions, and it was not just a matter of reading Thomas Merton, meditating and burning incense, I realized that I had been acting like a rich divorced woman with much too much time on her hands (Think of the British sitcom ""Absolutely Fabulous"" --- greatest show of all time after Seinfeld), and that if you're really goign to commit yourself to something you need to do more than scratch the surface. It was then, when all religious answers seemed to elude me, that I subscribed to agnosticism: athiesm with a parachute as my old English professor used to say. And on that note I remain today. I don't know the answer and therefore will not comment. Through all of it, however, one philosophy has given me freedom: the beginning of wisdom can be found in the notion that we don't have the answers. Do you say I have the answers because men wrote them in a book nearly 2000 years ago, and I can take their word for it? Hell, Frog, I don't take the word of a man who writes the answers in a book today, let alone 2000 years ago. I open the newspaper always skeptical. If you tell me something, you'd better be able to support it.  Now what I do believe is an entire scientific community which can back up their claims, publish them and open up their work for anyone else in the world with the means to duplicate these tests (or subject a hypothesis to a different test of their own design).   The problem with the Bible is that its primary source of evidence is the Bible. A bad comparison, but a comparison nonetheless would be my writing a book and telling you that book is the truth because I say so. Exceprts from the Bible which may point to actual historical events or documented figures do not by rote prove that Jesus walked on water. I call Bible-thumpers mindless because this has been my experience, Frog. Up close and personal. They think inside the very tiny box of their scriptures and ask that we accept it by faith. But the basis by which we're really accepting it is widescale social acceptance. If enough people, enough books, enough teachers point to this single source and say ""it is truth,"" then the cud-chewing masses will usually fall in line. But that doesn't necessarily mean I am going to buy it. I would prefer listening to people, books and teachers who point to many different sources and say this is truth. If I want to see evidence of the Bible I can read the Bible. If I want to see evidence of evolution I can visit our excellent museum of natural history here in Pittsburgh. If I want to discuss evidence of the Bible I can talk to someone who has read the Bible. If I want to discuss evidence of evolutoin I can talk to someone who has read books from many different disciplines of scientific thought. If I want to challenge myself with new questions about the Bible I can open the Bible. If I want to challenge myself with new questions about evolution I can go outside, take a walk in the woods, scribble in my notebook and come back to this forum with a 47 page post full of questions: the important point here being that others like Lurch and Demon would either be able to answer them or point me in the right direction of someone who can.

It has been proposed that modern humans descended from a single woman, the ""mitochondrial Eve"" who lived in Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. The human immune system DRB1 genes are extremely polymorphic, with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago, a time before the divergence of the apes from the Old World monkeys. The theory of gene coalescence suggests that, throughout the last 60 million years, human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater. Molecular evolution data favor the African origin of modern humans, but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence.

I think you will find that that view is oversimplyfied and not in accordance with the history of the subject.  Big Bang: Evolutionists are not concerned with the BB, per sae. Cosmologists on the other hand are. In very simple terms we have a factual observation: the universe is expanding with time. If we say, what does this mean for the past of th universe it can be postulated that the universe then becomes very small and hot if we go far back enough in time.  We then find that the laws that describe the behaviour of the physical universe start to break down; gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force and strong nuclear force. The pursuit of a Grand Unified Theory (GUT) and Theory of Everything is concerned with combining the laws that describe some or all of these forces to see if we can understand how the universe behaved very shortly after it began to expand.  What came before? this is not well understood at the moment. Some workers have suggested a cyclic universe in which more than one BB has occured over time. Don't forget though, cosmology is only concerned with the physical world, and not that which may lie outside of it.   Macroevolution: how do you know that this does not happen? if you are to say it has not been observed happening today, it is not surprising as our slow life cycles don't lend themselves to making a direct observation. If you posed this question in about 5000 years time, we may be in a sensible position to answer it with regard to a limited number of cases.

This law says that the entropy ('disorder') of the Universe increases over time, and some have thought that this was the result of the Curse. However, disorder isn't always harmful. An obvious example is digestion, breaking down large complex food molecules into their simple building blocks. Another is friction, which turns ordered mechanical energy into disordered heat-otherwise Adam and Eve would have slipped as they walked with God in Eden! A less obvious example to laymen might be the sun heating the Earth-to a physical chemist, heat transfer from a hot object to a cold one is the classic case of the Second Law in action. Also, breathing is based on another classic Second Law process, gas moving from a high pressure to low pressure. Finally, all beneficial processes in the world, including the development from embryo to adult, increase the overall disorder of the universe, showing that the Second Law is not inherently a curse.  Death and suffering of nephesh animals before sin are contrary to the Biblical framework above, as are suffering (or 'groaning in travail' (Rom. 8:20-22)). It is more likely that God withdrew some of His sustaining power (Col. 1:15-17) at the Fall so that the decay effect of the Second Law was no longer countered.","SO the 2nd law of thermodynamics didn't start at the fall, but it STILL disproves evolution!!! emoticon_frazzled."

I think my body has stopped growing (in height anyway), but seem to keep filling my brain with more and more experience.

"(422, 2)",-1.6,"Sigmund Freud divided all people into ""believers"" and ""unbelievers.""  Unbelievers include all those who consider themselves cynics, skeptics, scoffers, agnostics, or atheists. Believers include the rest, whose belief ranges from merely an intellectual assent that someone or something is out there to those like Lewis, Augustine, Tolstoy, and Pascal who have had a life-transforming experience after which their faith becomes the primary motivating and organizing principle of their lives.   Freud came down clearly and strongly against the notion that there is ""Anyone"" out there. He described his worldview as secular and called it ""scientific,"" and he claimed that no source of knowledge of the universe exists other than ""carefully scrutinized observation what we call research."" Therefore no knowledge, he said, can be derived from revelation or from intuition. He stated that the notion of the universe created by a being ""resembling a man but magnified in every respect, an idealized superman, reflects the gross ignorance of primitive peoples."" He stated that no intelligent person could accept the absurdities of the religious worldview.   Freud described the concept of God as merely a projection of the childish wish for the protection of an all-powerful father. He added that ""religion is an attempt to master the sensory world in which we are situated by means of the wishful world which we have developed within us as a result of biological and psychological abnormality.""   He concluded that the religious view is ""so pathetically absurd and . . . infantile that it is humiliating and embarrassing to think that the majority of people will never rise above it.""   Except for the brief time as a college student under the influence of a brilliant philosopher named Franz Bratano, a devout believer, when Freud wavered in his atheism, he stated that he remained an unbeliever all of his life. A year before he died, Freud wrote to Charles Sanger, ""Neither in my private life nor in my writing have I ever made a secret of being an out-and-out unbeliever.""   When we carefully assess the record, however, we find that Freud may not have been quite as adamant in his atheism as he proclaimed. Certainly he did refer to himself often as, ""an infidel Jew,"" and he rejected outright the religious view of the universe, especially the Judeo-Christian view. He certainly attacked this view with all his intellectual might and from every possible perspective. Yet, for some reason he remained preoccupied with these issues; he just could not leave them alone. He spent the last thirty years of his life writing about them.   In an autobiographical study he said that these philosophical and religious issues interested him throughout his life from early youth. A great deal of evidence exists that Freud's worldview proved less than comfortable for him. Faith was by no means a closed issue for him, and he was extremely ambivalent about God's existence.    Anna Freud, Sigmund's daughter who died a few years ago, explained to me the only way to know her father: ""Don't read his biographies;"" she instructed, ""read his letters."" Throughout Freud's letters are statements such as,  ""If someday we meet above,"" ""[my] one, quite secret prayer,"" and statements about God's grace.  During the last thirty years of Freud's life, he carried out a continuous exchange of hundreds of letters with a Swiss theologian, Oskar Phister.  It's interesting to note that his longest correspondence was with this theologian. He admired Phister and wrote,   ""You are a true servant of God . . . [who] feels the need to do spiritual good to everyone he meets. You did good this way even to me."" He later said that Phister was, ""In the fortunate position of being able to lead men to God.""

OK, Noah is 9 generations after Adam, and according to the story, a generation was like 200 years on average, plus at the time Noah built the ark, he was some 200 something himself (cant remember the exact figure). so say its 2000 years or so after the creation day. Anyway, its possible that not a lot of speciation took place in that time, plus its arguable that there wasnt a lot of migration away from the Eden area either. so all the animals in the Earth were relatively close-by, and there couldnt have been a great number of new or variant species from the ones originally created.

After Jefferson left office and retired to Monticello he continued to do business with a bookseller in Philadelphia named N. G. Dufief. Apparently on some occasions, Jefferson would purchase books that were sent directly to him at Monticello and Mr. Dufief would act as Jefferson's agent for payment. Jefferson would then, from time to time, settle accounts with Mr. Dufief.  That seems to have been the case with a book by M. de Becourt entitled, Sur la CrÃ©ation du Monde, un SystÃªme d'Organisation Primitive. Jefferson had seen notice of the book's publication and presumed it to be ""...either a geological or astronomical work."" He ordered it to be sent to him upon publication with instructions that Mr. Dufief be contacted for payment. Thus, Mr. Dufief became involved with a book that he had never seen. Mr. Dufief extended credit to Mr. Jefferson, as was his custom, and paid for the book.  But such little technicalities never stopped the forces of good in the community. From the title alone criminal charges were brought against Mr. Dufief for crimes against religion. I do not know to outcome of the case but presume that Mr. Dufief was acquitted. The quote that Debater got almost correct is from a letter that Jefferson wrote to Dufief about the matter. At the end of the letter Jefferson discusses settling accounts by adding the unknown price of Newton's Principia to his balance of $4.93 and sending it along to Philadelphia.

We now have a quarter of a million fossil species but the situation hasn't changed much. The record of evolution is still surprisingly jerky and, ironically, we have even fewer examples of evolutionary transition than we had in Darwin's time. By this I mean that some of the classic cases of darwinian change in the fossil record, such as the evolution of the horse in North America, have had to be discarded or modified as a result of more detailed information -- what appeared to be a nice simple progression when relatively few data were available now appears to be much more complex and much less gradualistic. So Darwin's problem has not been alleviated in the last 120 years and we still have a record which does show change but one that can hardly be looked upon as the most reasonable consequence of natural selection. Also the major extinctions such as those of the dinosaurs and trilobites are still very puzzling. (http://www.geocities.com/osarsif/ce01.htm).","The page linked to just above explains how a letter was sent to Dr. Raup asking for his statements about how he had been quoted by a Creationist journal (one of the quotes being the one being addressed here).

If a woman kills her toddler, that is homicide, and it isn't legal, and I don't see how it ever could/would be... all murder is illegal, but to call an abortion murder is really only your personal opinion on the issue, because as of now it is a legal procedure. Some people consider it to be murder, and some don't.. it isn't an open and shut thing either way; if it were, there wouldn't be so much debate over it, and if it were considered to be murder all around, no questions, then it would not be legal. Maybe the laws will change someday, who knows.. but right now it's not illegal for a woman to have an abortion. You can call it a double standard, but again that is mainly just opinion.

I know of one girl who had 7 by the time she was 22... that is pretty disturbing, and I don't think that it's really right to do it for reasons like that... like I said to her, if she were so afraid of getting pregnant, or getting 'fat', she should have either not had sex or she should have used protection... there are ways to prevent pregnancy, and birth control costs a hell of a lot less than an abortion (especially 7 times).. but at the same time I also had a friend who got pregnant, and got scared, and made an appointment to a clinic, and once she got there she didn't think she could go through with it, and now she has a healthy, adorable 5 year old and she is very thankful that she didn't have the abortion after all... but in the cases of my friends, all I could do was offer an opinion if they asked, but I didn't feel I had the right to tell them what to do either way.

"(5, 4)",-2,"""They believe that mechanistic evolution is just too improbable.""  Ah... do they now. You see, Berkinski et al seem to have a limited comprehension as to what causes life to change in space and time.  Where they see improbability I see inevitability- life, in whatever form we care to discuss, is vying to survive against a whole battery of challenges. Some of those challenges confront it on a short term basis- the need for food, suitable environmental conditions in which to survive and so on. Others may be an issue over a longer period of time- the need to find a mate and reproduce, can it survive annual changes in local climates. Ultimately, life has to be able to adapt to the longest term changes- like a major shift in underlying climatic conditions or local topography.  And so on- we can consider a whole host of changes that confronts life at various times over different timescales. What is clear from such consideration is the never ending need for life to able to adapt- the Earth is a dynamic and forever changing place (even the very ground beneath you now is transient in nature) and environments have changed dramatically over the course of this planets history. If life were still and static it would never have come to be in the first place. If it can not adapt to a new challenges quickly enough- well just think of all the examples we have of life that is extinct.  So I really cannot see why Berkinski and his peers find natural evolution, or whatever you care to call it improbable- the driving forces are there to see if you are inclined to learn about them.  What I really find improbable is the notion of an omnipotent supernatural enitity outside of the physical universe somehow being able to comprehend and interact with the life in ours- and even to have the desire to do so!","I believe you've missed the point.

Civil Unions are non-transportable, meaning a civil union from one state cannot be recognized in other states.   Now if you would like to call ALL legally recognized unions as Legal marriage, fine. That goes for heterosexuals as well. I just can't see that a heterosexual couple would ever want to enter into a ""civil union"" being as they would be denied spousal recognitions and transportability.   I have als been asked before, in another forum, if I would be opposed to leaving the decission up to individual states. My answer is, yes. Due to the fact that legal marriages between heterosexual couples are granted federal recognition, benefits and interstate transportability which would be denied to Civil Unions if left up to individual states.   Also we all know what would have happened if individual states were allowed to have determined women's right to vote, interracial marriage and de-segragation. None of those would have happened.  Sometimes the general public just doesn't know what's best for their state's citizens. Much of the voting public is simply just too under-informed or misinformed.

In this world, we will go back and forget that guns ever existed outside of the military. Thus, there will be no shooting deaths because no one has possession of a gun.  However, your utopia cannot exist because of the human tendancy to seek power. Marx thought that if everyone became equal, there would be no problems, and everyone could live together in perfect harmony. However, when everyone tried to live together, there was a group who tried to rise up and gain more power. In the end, people began to realize that Marx's ideas would not work because there would be an elite few who would attempt to screw everyone else over.  Gun control would produce the same results. The people would be the law-abiding citizens, and that elite few would be the criminals. The criminals, realizing that the rest of the people have no guns, would then attain guns through illegal means. They could then use their guns against the innocent law-abiding citizens, who have given up their guns and now have no equal force to resist with.

Why don't you try disputing facts than making up stories and childishly trying to copy me.  Here lets start with this.... Please read and explain to me how (if) any of these 40 things are wrong Mr. Civil-Rights violator:   1. Banning guns works, which is why New York, DC, & Chicago cops need guns.  2. Washington DC's low murder rate of 69 per 100,000 is due to strict gun control, and Indianapolis' high murder rate of 9 per 100,000 is due to the lack of gun control.  3. Statistics showing high murder rates justify gun control but statistics showing increasing murder rates after gun control are ""just statistics.""  4. The Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban, both of which went into effect in 1994 are responsible for the decrease in violent crime rates, which have been declining since 1991.  5. We must get rid of guns because a deranged lunatic may go on a shooting spree at any time and anyone who would own a gun out of fear of such a lunatic is paranoid.  6. The more helpless you are the safer you are from criminals.  7. An intruder will be incapacitated by tear gas or oven spray, but if shot with a .357 Magnum will get angry and kill you.  8. A woman raped and strangled is morally superior to a woman with a smoking gun and a dead rapist at her feet.  9. When confronted by violent criminals, you should ""put up no defense -- give them what they want, or run"" (Handgun Control Inc. Chairman Pete Shields, Guns Don't Die - People Do, 1981, p.125).  10. The New England Journal of Medicine is filled with expert advice about guns; just like Guns & Ammo has some excellent treatises on heart surgery.  11. One should consult an automotive engineer for safer seatbelts, a civil engineer for a better bridge, a surgeon for internal medicine, a computer programmer for hard drive problems, and Sarah Brady for firearms expertise.  12. The 2nd Amendment, ratified in 1787, refers to the National Guard, which was created 130 years later, in 1917.  13. The National Guard, federally funded, with bases on federal land, using federally-owned weapons, vehicles, buildings and uniforms, punishing trespassers under federal law, is a ""state"" militia.  14. These phrases: ""right of the people peaceably to assemble,"" ""right of the people to be secure in their homes,"" ""enumerations herein of certain rights shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the people,"" and ""The powers not delegated herein are reserved to the states respectively, and to the people"" all refer to individuals, but ""the right of the people to keep and bear arm"" refers to the state.  15. ""The Constitution is strong and will never change."" But we should ban and seize all guns thereby violating the 2nd, 4th, and 5th Amendments to that Constitution.  16. Rifles and handguns aren't necessary to national defense! Of course, the army has hundreds of thousands of them.  17. Private citizens shouldn't have handguns, because they aren't ""military weapons"", but private citizens shouldn't have ""assault rifles"", because they are military weapons.  18. In spite of waiting periods, background checks, finger printing, government forms, etc., guns today are too readily available, which is responsible for recent school shootings. In the 1940's, 1950's and1960's, anyone could buy guns at hardware stores, army surplus stores, gas stations, variety stores, Sears mail order, no waiting, no background check, no fingerprints, no government forms and there were no school shootings.  19. The NRA's attempt to run a ""don't touch"" campaign about kids handling guns is propaganda, but the anti-gun lobby's attempt to run a ""don't touch"" campaign is responsible social activity.  20. Guns are so complex that special training is necessary to use them properly, and so simple to use that they make murder easy.  21. A handgun, with up to 4 controls, is far too complex for the typical adult to learn to use, as opposed to an automobile that only has 20.  22. Women are just as intelligent and capable as men but a woman with a gun is ""an accident waiting to happen"" and gun makers' advertisements aimed at women are ""preying on their fears.""  23. Ordinary people in the presence of guns turn into slaughtering butchers but revert to normal when the weapon is removed.  24. Guns cause violence, which is why there are so many mass killings at gun shows.  25. A majority of the population supports gun control, just like a majority of the population supported owning slaves.  26. Any self-loading small arm can legitimately be considered to be a ""weapon of mass destruction"" or an ""assault weapon.""  27. Most people can't be trusted, so we should have laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.  28. The right of Internet pornographers to exist cannot be questioned because it is constitutionally protected by the Bill of Rights, but the use of handguns for self defense is not really protected by the Bill of Rights.  29. Free speech entitles one to own newspapers, transmitters, computers, and typewriters, but self-defense only justifies bare hands.  30. The ACLU is good because it uncompromisingly defends certain parts of the Constitution, and the NRA is bad, because it defends other parts of the Constitution.  31. Charlton Heston, a movie actor as president of the NRA is a cheap lunatic who should be ignored, but Michael Douglas, a movie actor as a representative of Handgun Control, Inc. is an ambassador for peace who is entitled to an audience at the UN arms control summit.  32. Police operate with backup within groups, which is why they need larger capacity pistol magazines than do ""civilians"" who must face criminals alone and therefore need less ammunition.  33.

Police officers have some special Jedi-like mastery over hand guns that private citizens can never hope to obtain.  35.

Then an experiment is designed and conducted to test the prediction. When the hypothesis has been tested strongly, it is called a theory.  From the evidence a hypothesis is formulated. The hypothesis is a proposed explanation that takes into account all of the observed facts. It is built on previous science, experience and sometimes guess work. Then comes the prediction, followed by the experiment that tests the prediction. If it passes, you may have a theory."
"(77, 6)",-3.4,"***Yawn*** revisionist history... Well here are the facts from http://www.gunowners.org/fs0404.htm:  D. Myth #4: Recent gun control laws have reduced the U.S. murder rate.  1. Murder rate was already decreasing before Brady and semi-auto gun ban passed. Those who claim that the two gun control laws enacted in 1994 have reduced the murder rate ignore the fact that the U.S. murder rate has been decreasing from the high it reached in 1991.172 Thus, the murder rate had already begun decreasing two to three years before the Brady law and the semi-auto gun ban became law.  2. Murder rate decrease results from fewer violent youths. The Democratic Judiciary Committee noted in 1991 that, ""An analysis of the murder tolls since 1960 offers compelling evidence of the link-the significant rise of murder in the late 1960's, and the slight decrease in murder in the early 1980's follows from an unusually large number of 18-24 year-olds in the general population. This age group is the most violent one, as well as the group most likely to be victimized-and the murder figures ebb and flow with their ranks.""173 (Emphasis added.)  3. According to the Clinton Justice Department, crime has decreased even while the number of guns increased. The Bureau of Justice Statistics, the research arm of the Justice Department, reported in 2000 that while the number of firearms in circulation rose nearly 10% during a recent five-year period, gun-related deaths and woundings dropped 33%.174  4. Concealed carry laws have dropped murder and crime rates in the states that have enacted them. According to a comprehensive study which studied crime statistics in all of the counties in the United States from 1977 to 1992, states which passed concealed carry laws reduced their murder rate by 8.5%, rapes by 5%, aggravated assaults by 7% and robbery by 3%.175.",BS.

"(226, 4)",-4.8,"Nature doesn't allow homosexual sex to create life, to reproduce, and though humans use sex as entertainment, it obviously was meant for a greater purpose. Biology shows us we need both male and female to create life, that male and male doesn't create life, that indivdual gratification doesn't create life. If you want to attach relgious or philosophical significance to sex you may at this juncture. That is why I think it is wrong. Humanity wouldn't be around if homosexuality were the standard, homosexuals wouldn't exist without heterosexuals. You may be looking for a more fundamental ""morality"" to my basis. I choose to validate my beliefs on science and years of living proof of heterosexualitie's superiority, and when I mean hetero superiority I mean strict hetero adhearance, no socially unacceptable behavior being thrown in like ""cheating"" or ""rape"".","Really?   If ""nature"" meant for all things to reproduce through heterosexual methods then maybe all other forms of reproduction would not exist, hmm. They would have been ""eliminated"" because heterosexuality is far superior. Think again. The majority of organisms on this planet reproduce using binary fission (bacteria dividing), asexual reproduction (there goes your ""individual gratification argument), and zygotic reproduction. None of these things require sexes of any type.   Even animals that have ""normal"" sexual reproduction can reproduce using a process known as parthenogenesis, in which only a female is required to produce offspring (turkeys and lizards do this). If homosexuality isn't natural or is inferior, then why do we see examples of it in nature. The bonobo (closely related to the chimpanzee) exhibits heterosexual and homosexual activity in both genders in the wild, and the bonobo and humans share a very common ancestor.   Look, you can't say that one way of reproduction is ""the standard"" since it is clear that different species reproduce in a variety of ways. You also can't say that homosexuality is a disorder if you follow your previous logic that what is ""natural"" is valid. Also, you said that heterosexuality is superior because it has a ""greater purpose"". By implying that something has a purpose, you stray from the realm of Science by assuming a teleology. If you want to assume that things were given ""purpose"" by some higher being, that's fine, but you'll have to stick to religion to defend your argument. In science, it is impossible to assume a purpose. For example, what is the purpose of a river? To flow to the ocean? To carve a canyon? To carry sediment? You can say what something is good at doing, or what it does, but you cannot say what it was ""made"" for (purpose) without implying some grand design that can be easily provided by your local religion. As for hetero and homosexuality, it can be said that heterosexuals are better at producing offspring than homosexuals. Does that automatically make heterosexuality superior based on the arbitrary criterion of number of offspring produced? So in the eyes of a value system that believes that something is valued higher that creates more offspring or ""life"", heterosexuality would be superior. But in the eyes of science and reason, your argument doesn't hold water."
"(631, 5)",-5,...where are the MILLIONS of links that supposedly connected them?,"Because of the rare nature of fossilisation, we don't expect to see perfect transitional lineages through millions and millions of years. I really don't think there are any scientists that think there SHOULD be millions and millions of transitions, because of the nature of fossilisation.  Science is like a detective story. If you wanted to solve a murder, for example, you take a look at the evidence. You have a gun, spent rounds, dead body etc. To convict someone of a murder, you need fingerprints, blood on clothes, DNA and such to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person you are accusing actually shot the deceased and you can convict WITHOUT an eye witness.  It's the same for science and the fossil record, because there is no-one around who directly observed animals undertaking large changes over time. But if you take a look at the fossil record, molecular biology, geological time etc, this is what it shows. From what we understand from the last 100 or so years of evidence and investigation, biological evolution is the best scientific explanation we have for the diversity of life on earth.  3 questions for Calligirl.  For the 4th time. What would be YOUR definition of a transitional form?  When calculating the age of this earth, how precise do you expect or want scientists to get?  How many transitional fossils would you LIKE to see in what period of time?  I really don't think this will progress if you can't tell us what it is you would like to see."
