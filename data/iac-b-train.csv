"(715, 1)",4.2,"South Dakota's Legislature: Human Life Begins at Conception   Susan Jones, CNSNews.com Friday, Feb. 27, 2004   The South Dakota House on Thursday joined the state Senate in passing a bill that says human life begins at conception - something that would outlaw all abortions in South Dakota, except in cases where the mother's health or life were endangered.  Pro-abortion groups called the bill ""a direct assault on South Dakotans' rights,"" and pro-life advocates see it as a way of directly challenging the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling that legalized abortion.  The bill's main sponsor, Republican state Rep. Matt McCaulley, called it the ""strongest, cleanest pro-life legislation"" passed by a state legislature since 1973.   Equal Protection  He and other supporters say unborn babies deserve equal protection under the 14th Amendment, and they say the state is within its rights to expand the definition of ""persons"" to include unborn babies.  ""If this is the case that goes to the Supreme Court to get them to overturn Roe versus Wade, so be it,"" a wire report quoted McCaulley as saying.  South Dakota's pro-life Republican Gov. Mike Rounds has not yet said whether he would sign the bill. He has until March 12 to make up his mind.  The bill makes it a crime to perform abortions. The penalties for doing so include up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine, unless a mother's life is in danger. The bill does not include exceptions for rape or incest.   McCaulley estimated that about 800 abortions are performed every year in South Dakota.  'Be Very Worried'  Every American who ""values a woman's right to choose"" should be worried, said Kate Michelman, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, in a press release.  Michelman said the bill, if upheld by the courts, could endanger the health of women, send doctors to prison for ""doing what is in the best medical interests of their patients,"" and insert government into personal decisions to the point where some widely used forms of birth control might be banned.  ""The anti-choice movement has not been shy about its two-pronged strategy for overturning Roe v. Wade,"" Michelman said.   She described the strategy as passing bills like the one in South Dakota, then forcing them into the court system and ""hoping that George Bush has the opportunity to put new justices on the Supreme Court who will take the opportunity that these bills provide them to take away reproductive freedom.""  NARAL Pro-Choice America describes itself as the ""leading national advocate of personal privacy and a woman's right to choose."".",YES!! Go South Dakota!! emoticon_xbouncer.
"(89, 4)",4.5,"If marriage is so sacred socially, then heterosexuals who get married should never divorce, and quickie marriages that celebrities have all of the time shouldn't be allowed (Not to mention things like Joe Millionaire and the Bachelorette). This shouldn't be a social issue because if it is, it's allowing the government to make individuals to adhere to a set of moral codes that only a select group believes.   The government should approach this as a legal matter, which it is, and allow the legally binding marriage of homosexuals which affords them the same benefits that every other couple who pays 80 bucks to a local courthouse can enjoy.

Otherwise, keep your mouth shut and let the government dole out legal unions (or dare I say ""marriages"") to same sex couples and let that be the end of it.

The word is a useful way to describe the legal binding of any two individuals who may have a different faith than the one where some claim the word's definition is derived from.

Why that is not true of the pro-choice side, is that we let the women choose, and she can choose both ways if she wishes. The pro-life movement involves force and blatant disregard for rights of the women, to the point of violation, yet the men have almost no knowledge of what it is like to get pregnant or have babies. Many pro-life men do know what raising a child is like, but they do not know what raising a child is like when you are a 14 year old girl with three kids already and no money.

I don't have to like the choices someone else makes, and I don't have to agree with it, but while I have that right, I also believe that people should have the right to make those decisions. Are these anti-abortion people going to step in and pay for the cost of having the baby, raising it, etc..??? Maybe some of those are the issues people consider when having an abortion. Maybe the woman was raped. I see the point when someone said that the baby should not be punished for that, and I agree with that, but the rape was committed against the woman's will... she didn't ask for that to happen, and if a pregnancy results from that, that is also against her will, so why should she feel that she has to have the child? What does she tell the child when it decides to ask who its father is?? The child could still be born and given up for adoption, and that is a good idea, but maybe the woman will relive the rape throughout the pregnancy by being reminded of it on a daily basis.... all I feel is until it happens to you, and YOU are forced to make these kinds of choices, you shouldn't judge anyone else for the choices that they make."

"(168, 6)",3.666666667,"Research Shows Gay Marriage Reduces VD An associate professor in the Department of Economics at Swarthmore College has written a paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research that shows how in Europe, where same-sex relationships have been granted legal recognition since 1989 (beginning in Denmark), there is a correlation between same-sex marriage (or civil unions) and a decline in the rate of at least one sexually transmitted disease, syphilis.  In ""Forsaking All Others? The Effects of 'Gay Marriage' on Risky Sex,"" Thomas S. Dee writes:  One of the conjectured benefits of establishing the legal recognition of same sex partnerships is that it would promote a culture of responsibility and commitment among homosexuals. A specific implication of this claim is that ""gay marriage"" will reduce the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STI). In this study, I present a simple 2-period model, which provides a framework for discussing the ways in which gay marriage might reduce (or increase) the prevalence of STI. Then, I present reduced-form empirical evidence on whether gay marriage has actually reduced STI rates. These evaluations are based on country-level panel data from Europe, where nations began introducing national recognition of same-sex partnerships in 1989. The results suggest that these gay marriage laws led to statistically significant reductions in syphilis rates. However, these effects were smaller and statistically imprecise with respect to gonorrhea and HIV. [from the paper's abstract]  Professor Dee is no neophyte or quirky economist working on a pet project. He has contributed articles to numerous academic journals and chapters to several books, including No Child Left Behind?: The Politics and Practice of School Accountability, Developments in School Finance, and An Economic Analysis of Risky Behavior Among Youths.  Dee's concluding paragraph suggests the impact on both the U.S. economy and public health that could ensue from legalizing gay relationships:  These results suggest that gay marriage might reduce, perhaps dramatically, the social costs associated with STI like syphilis. In the United States, over 34,000 cases of 25 syphilis were reported in 2003 (CDC 2004b). And the direct and indirect annual costs of syphilis have been estimated at nearly $1 billion, which reflects in large part, the role that syphilis plays in spreading HIV (CDC 1999). However, the policy relevance of these results probably extends beyond the issue of improvements in public health. For many who are debating the desirability of gay marriage, these results may be more important because of what they suggest about the likely effects of gay marriage on the degree of personal commitment in same-sex relationships.   The full paper provides extensive economic analysis, including charts and graphs, and is worth reading for all those concerned about the prospect of equal-marriage rights in the United States -- whether proponents or opponents of the concept. http://ricksincerethoughts.blogspot.com/2005/05/research-shows-gay-marriage-reduces-vd.html.","Yes, and it reduces a much needed population growth too. emoticon_xgood."

Of course, one could argue the religious view of a soul external to our bodies determining at least part of our mental existence, but there is no evidence to support any such religious view - it is all taken on faith.

To me it is self evident that there is no person or personhood without a personal identity.   There might be disagreement about what the particulars are concerning how to identify a personal identity, but it seems self evident to me that a mind is required, and without a brain, there is no mind, so a brain is required. It seems to me self evident that if there is no brain, there is no person. Of course, others will disagree.  Some say that the unique DNA of a zygote is enough for personal identity, but if this is true, identical twins (with identical DNA) would have to share one personal identity, and one soul.

(We know that black folks have black kids; white folks, white kids; tall parents tend to have tall children; and so on.)  4)If many offspring must die (for not all can be accommodated in nature's limited ecology), and individuals in all species vary among themselves, then on average survivors will tend to be those individuals with variations that are fortuitously best suited to changing local environments. Since heredity exists, the offspring of survivors will tend to resemble their successful parents. The accumulation of these favorable variants through time will produce evolutionary change.","A fairly good explanation, toned down a bit from Darwin's explanation (for the average person who does not have a PHD in biology)."

Sam Brownback, who wants to champion social conservatives in the presidential race, said Tuesday he wants a Senate panel to re-question a judicial nominee who attended a same-sex union ceremony.  Brownback, a Kansas Republican, said he wants Michigan state judge Janet Neff to testify about her role in the 2002 Massachusetts ceremony, her legal views on same-sex unions and her ability to be impartial if called upon to rule on such cases.  Neff's nomination to a federal district court is among a dozen or so now stalled in the Senate, a logjam in part due to Brownback's questions about Neff's attendance at a lesbian commitment ceremony. The Senate Judiciary Committee has already approved her nomination.  Neff was traveling outside the country and could not immediately be reached for comment, said Chris Bockheim, her judicial assistant.  Earlier this month, Brownback, a prominent opponent of gay marriage who is exploring a presidential run in 2008, said he would lift the hold he put on Neff's nomination if the judge agreed to withdraw from ruling on any court case involving the legality of same sex unions. http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/12/19/brownback.judge.ap/index.html?eref=rss_politics   Doesn't this just REEK of hypocrisy and partisanship?

Certain branches of Christianity, like Catholisism, have traditionally been very resistant to change. Unwilling to adapt, one might say. And the Catholic church has been in a state of decline of late. The social climate in which Catholosism thrived no longer exists, and so it isn't doing as well. We also see lots of little churches springing up, filling religious enviromental niches, as it were.   What can we predict for the future? Here's my guess. The two main enviromental factors that will shape religion will be a desire for stability and an ability to adapt to new ideas. As communication and travel become easier, people will be exposed to more new ideas and cultures, and religions will be forced to deal with people saying ""Yeah, but what about this new idea I just heard? How does that fit in?"" On the other hand, as people get exposed to other ideas, they'll want to have some core of ideas of their own to hold on to. Sort of a psychological anchor.   I figure we should expect to see the more dogmatic churches fade away, as people become exposed to more, different ideas. If you can't adapt, you become extinct.

"(173, 6)",2.5,"It becomes somewhat irritating to deal with people who's ignorance is matched only by their arrogance. Election day saw a sweeping repudiation of legally sanctioned same sex marriage in 11 different states, including relatively progressive Oregon. This follows similiar votes for amendments defining marriage in California and Missouri. What does this all mean? Well, for starters, it indicates that a federal marriage amendment has a fighting chance. It should remind us that sanctioning gay nuptials hasn't one thing to do with the oval office occupant. It is well known, or should be known, that the process for amending the constitution does not involve the President.  The Amendment Process  There are essentially two ways spelled out in the Constitution for how it can be amended. One has never been used.  The first method is for a bill to pass both halves of the legislature, by a two-thirds majority in each. Once the bill has passed both houses, it goes on to the states. This is the route taken by all current amendments. Because of some long outstanding amendments, such as the 27th, Congress will normally put a time limit (typically seven years) for the bill to be approved as an amendment (for example, see the 21st and 22nd).  The second method prescribed is for a Constitutional Convention to be called by two-thirds of the legislatures of the States, and for that Convention to propose one or more amendments. These amendments are then sent to the states to be approved by three-fourths of the legislatures or conventions. This route has never been taken, and there is discussion in political science circles about just how such a convention would be convened, and what kind of changes it would bring about.  Regardless of which of the two proposal routes is taken, the amendment must be approved by three-fourths of states. The amendment as passed may specify whether the bill must be passed by the state legislatures or by a state convention. See the Ratification Convention Page for a discussion of the make up of a convention. Amendments are sent to the legislatures of the states by default. Only one amendment, the 21st, specified a convention. In any case, passage by the legislature or convention is by simple majority.  It is interesting to note that at no point does the President have a role in the formal amendment process (though he would be free to make his opinion known). He cannot veto an amendment proposal, nor a ratification.  In spite of this, opponents of a marriage amendment acted as if defeating Bush would spell the death of such a proposal. Apparently, it's easier to identify a single scapegoat or hold up an unworthy strawman for condemnation than it is to recognize that there is an overriding public sentiment against alternative lifestyles being officially sanctioned.",I've seen people (on TV:)) who would actually know about such things say that the fact that these things passed in these states pretty much spels doom for any possible constitutional ammendment.

Every week, they pick out an intersection and hold up gigantic graphic posters, close up bloody pics of aborted babies converted into 6 ft. X 3 ft. posters. Everyone who drives down the street gets these images forced upon them, adults and children, and I just can't agree with this tactic.

Standing on the roadside holding signs and distracting drivers apparently is not. Two days ago I saw the largest intersection protest I have witnessed. There must have been fifty to one hundred protesters holding the giant posters.   Part of the reason it happens so often where I live is because we have an abortion clinic that serves most of northern Illinois outside of the Chicago area. The mis-named Northern Illinois Women's Center is in fact an abortion mill located in a former school (of all things). So that tends to rile folks up. That the owner of the building decided to name the building ""Fort Turner"" and put a large sign out in front (Turner being the former name of the school) didn't help matters. Bringing in a tanker truck with manure and threatening to hose down the protestors - now that was funny. Once, a Catholic priest rammed his car into the building to gain access then got out of the vehicle and started chopping the place up with an axe, until he was arrested. Needless to say, the abortion ""clinic"" has been a flashpoint in the community since it was opened at least 20 years ago.  Now there are always protestor's walking with signs in front of the abortion mill, and I can certainly understand that. IMHO that is where they SHOULD be protesting.

Gilbert, Sinauer Associates Inc., 2003, p500).","Another characteristic in this same general area that ties us back to fish is the development of our parathyroid glands - which are very similar to gill buds in fish - from a particular pharyngeal arch: the same one that in fish gives rise to the gill buds!  Moving on to the kidneys for a minute. The human embryo forms not one, but 3 successive kidneys: the pronephric, mesonephric, and metanephric kidneys. Only that last one persists and only it is the kidney you and I and all of our fellow humans use. Why do human embryos go through two transient and simpler kidneys before getting it right? Here's a hint: the other two are carry overs from simpler organisms! The evolutionarily simplest vertebrates, such as hagfish and teleost fish, develop only the pronephric kidney: it is their adult functional kidney. Now move up an evolutionary notch to (other) fish and amphibians. In their embryos, the first kidney still develops, but soon begins to degenerate and is replaced by the mesonephric kidney, which is the functional adult kidney in these organisms. Now move up another evolutionary notch, to reptiles, birds, and mammals. Their embryos form the first kidney, which then degenerates and is replaced by the second kidney, which then degenerates and is replaced by the final, metanephric kidney: their adult functional kidney.  The above is not anywhere near a complete list of embryological evidences for common descent/evolution.  PS: Note the serial addition of developmental stages that occurs in kidneys as one moves up to higher evolutionary levels: ""ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"". Of course this ""law"" does not hold for all organs/organ systems in all organisms, but it does hold for a few cases. And that's enough to clearly indicate evolution of those organ systems by their being retained from ancestors and then modified during embryonic development."

However, the AIG does list Thomas Barnes who's highest earned degree is an MS in physics, his Sc.D being honorary from his undergraduate, Christian university.

The name ""Steve"" (and variations thereof) comprises about 1% of the population. The percentage of qualified scientists with that name cannot be far from the norm. The Steve list was initially composed of scientists with PhD degrees biology, geology, paleontology, or a related scientific field. However, there are also scientists in fields such as cosmology and astrophysics that are signatories as well as other fields with an interest in evolutionary theory. For example, Stephen Hawking has signed the Steve list.  I invite you to find bogus and inappropriate degrees on the Steve list. I am sure that the NCSE would be appreciative of your efforts. Hopefully you will have a more difficult time than I did in identifying bogus degrees.  Oh, yes. In my experience, creationist scientists were always creationist long before they were scientists.

That is, as the gaps in knowledge become smaller, the God of these gaps becomes correspondingly smaller. People with this mentality see science as a threat to their faith. Obviously, were such a view held by the founders of modern science, there would have been no incentive to find answers to the natural phenomena.

Either the creationist says the Bible is true down to the last detail or the anti-creationists say it is totally false and absolutely nothing as described ever happened.  I wish to wave the flag for the middle ground. I do not believe that the Bible is 100% accurate historically. I do believe that many events (including the flood) happened in some form or other and many of these are long-ago racial memories which may well have been enhanced/distorted/spun over the course of millenia.  Trying to date the early parts of the Bible is effectively impossible. It is hard enough later on even at the time of the 'slavery' in Egypt.  Much more interesting to try and workout what may have happened.,"I think that this is my view of it all as well. A lot of the events of the bible (mainly the old testament) are things that might have occured in one form or another, and much of the events of the New Testament DID occur.  An example of my view is that I think that the flood did happen. It all started as a very large flood (probably in a river valley) that was much larger than normal (say a ""500-year-flood"" or a larger discharge event), possibly destroying a bunch of dwellings and maybe killing a lot of people, but some surviving leading to the Noah character. Eventually over the millenia, it got distorted and blown well out of proportion until it became a flood that covered the entire world. Then it led to the Epic of Gilgmesh, which was then adopted by those writing the early books of the Bible under the form it is seen as today."

The ark floated about like a cork for 40 days, etc whereupon the cargo was released to repopulate the world to present population levels. Meanwhile, there must have been provisions on the Ark for marine animals and fish as the rainwater would have undoubtedly altered the water pH and saline content. Also not mentioned is the fact that Noah and sons must have collected seeds from every PLANT on earth because I am personally not aware of many plant types that can survive completely submerged for 40 days.   So you see, it is much harder to believe in a fossil record and sediment deposit stratigraphy, than in a giant boat crammed to the gills full of elephants, octopus, and cacti.

Much research (not my own, look for research by Robert Denver) has shown that chemicals in the water produced by predators when feeding on prey, or changing environments in general, activate pathways in the body which in turn lead to increased tail size and differentiation of color. It has nothing to do with the tadpoles ""desire"" to have a larger or redder tail, it is simply a physiological response. The tadpoles have not ""evolved"" during the course of their development, as you assert. An induced phenotype is not heritable, the ability to induce it is.

What astounds me is that those who favor abortion went through an identical development stage as the being they are condemning to death. Would these very same people agree that a similiar choice should have been made about their own existence? Abortion today is used primarily as a birth control of convenience because people are too self-centered to take precautions. They prefer their own pleasurable self-indulgence over the care and sanctity of the life they created. What ever happened to taking responsibility for one's actions in this country? Is it too much to ask a woman who has conceived to place the child into adoption? Nine months of discomfort is nothing compared to life in prison for voluntary manslaughter! Does the father of the child have a say in this? And what about the constitution of the United States? Are not all people conceived in this country deserving of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness? I believe abortion is a crime against humanity and should be outlawed. We need to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision and get back to cherishing life in this country. For a country that murders it's children cannot be far from self destruction.","Hi Joe, welcome to the forum.

This change in tact by scientists is too bad, because I think evolution and the facts would be better served by taking the high road. The facts don't NEED insults to be facts; science doesn't need evangelism and crusading to be science.

Coelophysis, from the late Triassic was one of the first theropod dinosaurs.  Deinonychus and Oviraptor from the late Triassic to the Cretaceous were bipedal advanced theropods, larger, with more bird-like skeletal features: semilunate carpal, bony sternum, long arms and reversed pubis. Striking detailed similarity to birds.  There is a gap in the fossil record here although Protoavis could belong here, unfourtunately, the fossil is poor.  Archaeopteryx  from 225 Ma, shows a mosaic of reptilian and avian features, with the reptilian features predominating. The skull and skeleton are basically reptilian (skull, teeth, vertebrae, sternum, ribs, pelvis, tail, digits, claws, generally unfused bones). Bird traits are limited to an avian furcula (wishbone, for attachment of flight muscles; recall that at least some dinosaurs had this too), modified forelimbs, and -- the real kicker -- unmistakable lift-producing flight feathers. Archeopteryx could probably flap from tree to tree, but couldn't take off from the ground, since it lacked a keeled breastbone for large flight muscles, and had a weak shoulder compared to modern birds. (Wellnhofer, 1993)  S. santensis from 138 Ma was a better flyer than Archaeopteryx. It had a short trunk, claws on the toes, flight-specialized shoulders, stronger flight- feather bones, tightly folding wrist and short hands.  A not yet named bird/dino from 131 Ma has a reptilian pelvis and legs, with bird-like shoulders. The tail is medium-length with a fused tip.  Then there's Hesperornis, Ichthyornis, and other Cretaceous diving birds. There are many fossils. Their skeleton is further modified for flight showing fusion of pelvis bones, fusion of hand bones and a short, fused tail). It also still had true socketed teeth, a reptilian trait.  There are others and this is by no mean exhaustive. This is just to show that there are very good transition lineages.  Although no modern birds have teeth, chicken bills can be induced to develop teeth, indicating that chickens still retain the genes for making teeth.  There is also an intriguing fossil Microraptor gui that has flight feathers on both the front and back legs. http://eur.news1.yimg.com/eur.yimg.com/xp/reuters_ids/20030123/i/2567138235.jpg   I can provide more info on any of these if you wish.

Instead of being ignorant to the fact that they will learn about it, they should step in and at least educate them a bit about it in a proper way. Most (but not all) of the teen pregancies that I've witnessed have occurred amoung girls who attend a catholic school. Though we cannot blame this all entirely on lack of education. Since their other sources of sex are not so great, there could be a problem with such a high availability of these sources in our culture. There is a difference in treating sexual behaviour as taboo and letting it srawl out of control, teaching teenagers about it in the wrong way.

I find it truly insulting that this great nation, which was founded upon the idea of religious freedom has allowed so many of its laws to be affected by the over-dominant christian right. If we put aside the bible, the commandments, and the intentionally biased commentaries of christian leaders, what argument is left?  The Christian right will say that all life is precious, but obviously there are tiers. An unborn, unwanted, and even sometimes malformed child is more precious than that of the mother. Who cares if she was raped? Who cares if she was the victim of incest? Who cares if the child she carries has tested positive for all sorts of defects- ""My preacher says it's wrong!"" Another disturbing all too common event is that of the woman who has taken her prescribed birth control, but it failed, so she finds herself carrying a child she never wanted, and even worse, as a result of the augmented hormone levels as a result of birth control, her child has little chance of being born normal and healthy. But if these ""pro-lifers"" have their way, she will be forced to have the child, and raise it. Another argument I often hear is the option of adoption. One must wonder, though, if adoptive families were so abundant, why so many group homes for unwanted children who are doomed to live out their childhoods at the knees of the state? The gross majority of open-adoption agencies out there are christian-founded, which means of course, that unless you adhere to their strict guidelines, you will not recieve a child. Single parents (no matter the income) homosexuals, any person who does not subscribe to christianity is immediately disqualified!

But in cases where the woman uses what I think are trivial reasons, such as they don't want to lose their figure, or they have to much to do before they have a child, I don't agree with it.

In my opinion, it should be made an option for medical reasons, not the little trivial reasons like my friends used.. but even then to me it doesn't seem right...  After what I just went through, I got a first hand look at how horrible it really is, and even though I knew that medically that was the only choice, morally and emotionally it still doesn't seem like it should have been that way. Maybe it's because I didn't want to do it, but knew I had to, as opposed to someone choosing to have it done, but I almost wish it hadn't been an option, because then you don't have to make that choice. It's a very hard thing to deal with, no matter what the reasons behind it, and knowing you can't change it.. but I do know if something like this happens again, it won't be an option to me, no matter how many doctors tell me otherwise.

"(237, 5)",1.666666667,Thanks for your input.,"Start with the largest most powerful calibur you can get and physically handle. Then consider:  Practice = lots of ammo.  Lots of ammo = cost increase with larger calibur. Practice = responsible gun owner. Training = responsible gun owner. Large calibur = ability to stop the attack quickly. Small calibur = less likely to exit your target and hit someone behind it. Well placed shots from a small calibur are superior to a large calibur that missed.  As a bare minium take a training course that teaches you to handle low light conditions and drawing from a concealed holster. When you need it most are under conditions most favored by criminals, e.g. from behind, up close, in the dark, with suprise, or any combinations of them.  A good instructor will also inform you of all the legal implications of having to defend yourself, the implications of comming to the aid of other people, the legal implications of defense on public and private property, etc.  Personally I have made the decision that I WILL NOT help anyone in mortal danger whom I do not know. The legal implications if you are wrong are very drastic. You can never know the complete conditions of strangers and how they got to be in mortal danger, for all you know the person who just pulled out a gun may be an undercover cop. Thus I will only come to the aid for friends and family whom I know and thier business. My personal decision.  The guys at the gun store are interested with selling you a pistol with the highest profit margin. Not the best tool for you. Only way to find out is with trigger time and carry time on the pistol. So you may have to horse trade a few times until you find the right one.  My personal opinion? A very small .38 revolver with more than one holster. Sometimes you need to carry it on your ankle, sometimes in your pocket, or sometimes on your hip. Plus a ton of ammo for practice. The ammo you spend on practice can soon cost more than the pistol.  Los of inexpensive, reliable, and well built .38's. Not a lot of fun to shoot, but hey, this is a tool with a very specific purpose. Of course of you can deal with more, by all means upgrade to more. Your not going to place a sniper shot between the eyes of a felon. Most likely you will need it at night, very quickly, and at a little longer than ""knife fighting distances"".  I use a .45 auto. I shoot a full size .45 for fun. Train with the full size .45, but I carry a compact .45. The compact has exactly the same shape in my hand as the large .45, thus when I have to go the the small .45 quickly, it will retain the same operation and configuration in my hand as the large .45. The large .45 has more fun factor, not a lot of fun to carry a big piece of steel on your hip all day.  Plus I reload the .45 empties. The cost of a large calibur with reloading becomes as much as a smaller calibur when the ammo is store bought. The time spent reloading keeps me out of bars on week nights and my girlfriend more comforted.  By the end of the day, after carrying even the compact .45. I wish I had a small .38. The most effecient solution I have seen was a friend who both had a .357 magnum and .22 of the same pistol. He practiced with the .22 pistol all he wanted and very cheaply. Shot the .357 magnum just enough to practice with the recoil. The .22 and .357 had exactly the same size, shape, and trigger pull.  My $.02."

While they were debating whether or not to ammend the bill to include the assault weapons ban, Feinstein (d-california) claimed that the assault weapons ban legislation ""has reduced the proportion of banned assault weapons traced to crime by two-thirds.""

Don't sign the form - you don't get the gun."
"(705, 0)",1,"I've been thinking this over and I've come to the conclusion that ballistic ""fingerprinting"" is the stupidest thing I have ever heard.  As a crime fighting tool and especially a prosecutorial tool, it's worth would be questionable and actually extremely damaging.   The characteristics recorded; land and grooves (rifling) on the projectile, breech face marks, firing pin indent and extractor marks on the spent cartridge case, could all be corrupted with the expenditure of about 20 minutes of easy work with a small file and/or a new barrel. For some of the more popular handguns, we're talking $20 for a new barrel.   Imagine the enterprising criminal with an extra $200.00 in his pocket. He could buy replacement barrels for a few of the more popular handguns and have a lucrative swapping out service. He trades out the first barrel and places the one now ""in hand"" in the next gun. No barrels need to be destroyed, all that needs to be done to defeat the system is have discrepancies between original manufacturer's supplied projectile on record for a certain serial number gun and the crime scene recovered projectile.   ""Lieutenant, this bullet the coroner recovered from Virgil's head goes with serial number xw34t67. The gun we found under Harry's mattress, which we can prove killed Virgil, is number jy57p19.  What good does that do us?""  Realistically, at that point would any further detective manhours be expended trying to figure out how this happened? The barrels were swapped, any evidence as far as ballistic ""fingerprinting"" is concerned, is corrupted. Move on . . .  How about the questions raised for the prosecution if say Harry does go to trial for shooting Virgil with only two marks matching out of four? Let's see, was the ejector swapped out too? Maybe it's reloaded ammo, it's got three ejector marks on it, which firing was incidental to the criminal act?  Another important question; would such a partial, 2 out of 4 or otherwise inconclusive match, (which probably would not be offered as evidence or even admissible in court), be accepted as probable cause for a search or an arrest warrant?   The next, even more important question is:   If the bullets (original, supplied by manufacturer and the recovered crime scene bullet) don't match, doesn't that open a Pandora's Box of claims of ""I'm being framed!""???   The defendant could claim that it was the police, not him, that swapped barrels.   Harry says,"" the cops got a sample bullet from my gun and the bullet that done killed Virgil don't match! They put a different barrel in my gun that matches the bullet they said was in Virgil's noggin""   The state would be providing four pieces of potentially ironclad exculpatory evidence for the defendant! (again, land and grooves on the projectile and breech face marks, firing pin indent and extractor marks on the spent cartridge case)   The defense will of course enter into evidence a STATE SEALED document attesting that the following data represents the official --exclude all others -- ""ballistic fingerprint"" for Harry's gun, S/N-jy57p19. The problem for the authorities is, while they can prove that Harry's gun killed Virgil, (using standard forensic ballistics) that fact does not matter anymore because the crime scene bullet, the one in Virgil's noggin, matches a different gun, not placed in evidence by the prosecution and nowhere to be found . . .   This would create a new level to the prosecutor's burden of proof, now he has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that THIS defendant also swapped the barrel and corrupted other ""fingerprints"" for his weapon in addition to actually firing the weapon that killed the victim.   I think that more times than not, this will be an impossible additional hurdle to jump and the outcome of that will be allot of criminals will go free.  This ""new"" science of ballistic ""fingerprinting"" would in essence destroy the well established and deserved good reputation of forensic ballistics. I think this proposal will work directly against law enforcement and in the end, help criminals.  Debate questions:  Does this ballistic fingerprint proposal, with all the inherent questions it raises, realistically help or hurt the police and prosecutors? Does it increase or lessen the hours needed to solidify a case?   Can anyone prove to me that criminals will not go free using a corrupted ballistic ""fingerprint"" as their legal leverage?","That crime fighting tool senario you just described is REALLY REALLY spooky. They way our justice system works is: 1) crime is commited 2) suspects are considered 3) evidence against one suspect builds and is arrested 4) suspect is given a fair trial with all the evidence present to a judge and jurry.  In our system of justice, collection of evidence is PROHIBITED by the 4th Amendment without probable cause. There is no crime, thus no exuse to collect evidence.

They would agree absolutely with your 2 fundemental truths at the start of your post. However, they do not see it as a history as such, but more as an analogy to what happened. Some take it simply to say that God created the universe and put a soul in humans and find the detail of that (not the soul bit) in what we have discovered through science. Others would say it becomes ""historical"" at a certain point- Adam and Eve or maybe Noah. I don't think they are any less christian than those who choose to believe the story of creation literally, and it would surprise me to hear someone say that was the case.  I think it does pose some awkward questions to hold such a view though, and while I don't see all your 8 examples in your later post as being the ones I have heard, they are certainly of that nature.  Christianity has struggled with the logical conclusions of observation of the physical world for much time. Some of the examples from history are amusing today- the Omphilodian Heresy where the very discussion of whether Adam and Eve had navels was a heinous religous crime. The Heliocentricity debate where the Catholic Church eventually relented their scripture based denial of the earth orbiting the sun. And today the debate over the old earth and evolution.  This seems to arrive from the fact that the religon is so encompassing in its assertion of truth. While this helps to create a powerful system of belief, it can put it in an awkward position when new discovery is made. The nature of peolpe seems to be the same conflicts have arisen again and again- with just the point of contention changing."

CAT scans of the inner ear of HH showed that the semi-circular cannals, which determine balance and locomotion, are more like those of baboons than those of humans. This is not what one would expect if the evolutionary story about human origins is true, HH should be more bipedal than the Lucy type skeleton from which it supposedly evolved from, but it is not. In fact, most scientists now think that HH is not one creature, but instead is several types of creatures that do not belong together, at least three or more different animals, hence making it an invalid category. Further more, it cannot be our ancestor as no such animal ever existed.  Hence, the evidence is interpreted more sensibly and reasonable through a creationary model. This is just an example of what they may do with some fossils, IMVHO."

Oftentimes (21.3%, U.S.), a woman decides to have and abortion because she cannot afford a baby (from here, source). This is in effect removing members of society who are non-productive (babies produce virtually nothing useful until they mature by about 10 years). And poor families are less productive, since they are often on welfare.  Granted, this is a rather harsh perspective, but the effect is the same: In the U.S., there are about (21.3% X 1.31 million) 280,000 less people every year who would have likely grown up in a poor home (assuming the child wouldn't have been adopted).

She has the same right to control her bodily resources as any other person does. As such, you can no more force her, against her will, to provide bodily resources to an embryo or fetus, than you can yourself be forced to give of your bodily resources against your will.  Even if somebody is bleeding to death, and your blood can save their life, they still don't have the right to force you to safely give them of your blood.  Each person have that right to control their bodily resources. If you want to force the woman to remain pregnant, you are forcing her to give of her bodily resources against her will. When you don't insist that everybody else be subject to such requirements, then the argument is hypocritical and misogynistic.

Even Darwin hypothesized that changes that caused speciation took place in peripheral segments of the population.

Is there a link to the Pennsylvania laws like that..that was very informative.,"Sorry, I don't know PA's law or if there is a link to it. Va follows the old common law rules for self defense.   From what I have read of the new (and much criticized by the media elite) Florida self defense bill, it sounds like Florida is just returning to the old common law standard for justifiable self-defense, where retreat to the wall is not required when faced with a threat of deadly force. The first I heard of the new law change in Fla. was from the misfortune of watching a CBS nightly news story on it. The reporter said with disbelief in his voice (the kind of ""my God what are they doing!"" panic you hear when someone passes a law they don't like) that the new law states that if you shoot someone you are actually presumed innocent of any crime. My only comment on this is that the reporter obviously knows nothing of our legal system. Whenever any person is prosecuted for any crime, whether in Fla. or anywhere else in America, that person is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. I thought about e-mailing our standard jury instruction to the CBS guy:  THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT the defendant is presumed innocent. You should not assume the defendant is guilty because he has been indicted and is on trial. This presumption of innocence remains with the defendant throughout the trial and is enough to require you to find the defendant not guilty unless and until the Commonwealth proves each and every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. This does not require proof beyond all possible doubt, nor is the Commonwealth required to disprove every conceivable circumstance of innocence. However, suspicion or probability of guilt is not enough for a conviction. There is no burden on the defendant to produce any evidence. A reasonable doubt is a doubt based on your sound judgment after a full and impartial consideration of all the evidence in the case.  In any event, I have heard the re-tread of the same old arguments again about Fla. becoming the ""wild, wild west,"" ""traffic accidents becoming shootouts,"" and Fla. becoming the ""gunshine state."" These are the same arguments which were made when Fla. adopted a concealed carry law. I believe they will prove just as ignorant now as they did then."

""The bishop instructed me not to take Communion and said that he has instructed the diocesan priests not to give me Communion,"" Kennedy told the paper in an interview conducted Friday.

Further to that, the complexity and ""order"" of the universe is evidence of the work of an intelligent designer.  Is that fair enough?  So if nothing intelligent and no information can be created, how did the creator get created?

John Woodmorappe, in his book, Noah's Ark: A Feasibility Study, Inst for Creation Research (July 1, 1996), 298 pp., ISBN: 0932766412 did exactly that. Essentially Woodmorappe equated ""kinds"" to genus in most cases, with an occasional family that contained an inordinate number of genera thrown in where he couldn't make all of them fit. Woody came up with 15,754 ""kinds"", and calculates that there would have been enough room on the ark for all of them. He also calculated the room requirements based on the median size of the animals rather than the average size. Of course, he leaves off all plants, arthropods, mollusks, fish, and aquatic mammals. I don't recall if he included the dinosaurs, but Ken Ham, Kent Hovind, Carl Baugh and the like have them on the ark.  You correctly assume that the creationist story would be that there was a ""dog king"" and a ""cat kind"" from which all species evolved in a few years after the flood. Never mind that a single pair of cats could not possibly carry enough genetic diversity to evolve all 36 species of cat in 4 genera, not even in the 4,500 years since the flood was claimed to have occurred. In order to cram all the ""kinds"" on the ark, creationists must leave off everything but mammals and birds (without ever explaining how they could have survived a flood that lasted a year), and then propose hyper-evolution at rates that make evolutionary biologists dizzy, calling it ""variation in kind.""  It should also be noted that ""John Woodmorappe"" is a pen name of Jan Peczkis, a science teacher from Chicago with a degree in earth science. Besides his young earth creationist articles as Woodmorappe, Peczkis has also published old earth articles in peer reviewed literature. At one time Peczkis threatened to sue several people on the internet who revealed the duplicity (one being Joe Meert of the University of Florida geology department. Radiometric Dating, Paleosols and the Geologic Column). If he consulted a lawyer, I'm sure that he was laughed out of the office, since you can't sue someone for slander if what they say is true.

"(1145, 0)",1.2,"Third, the violinist illustration is not parallel to pregnancy because it equates a stranger/stranger relationship with a mother/child relationship. This is a key point and brings into focus the most dangerous presumption of the violinist illustration, also echoed in McDonagh's thesis. Both presume it is unreasonable to expect a mother to have any obligations towards her own child.   The violinist analogy suggests that a mother has no more responsibility for the welfare of her child than she has to a total stranger. McDonagh's view is even worse. She argues the child is not merely a stranger, but a violent assailant the mother needs to ward off in self-defense.   This error becomes immediately evident if we amend Thompson's illustration. What if the mother woke up from an accident to find herself surgically connected to her own child? What kind of mother would willingly cut the life-support system to her two-year-old in a situation like that? And what would we think of her if she did?   Blood relationships are never based on choice, yet they entail moral obligations, nonetheless. This is why the courts prosecute negligent parents. They have consistently ruled, for example, that fathers have an obligation to support their children even if they are unplanned and unwanted.   If it is moral for a mother to deny her child the necessities of life (through abortion) before it is born, how can she be obligated to provide the same necessities after he's born? Remember, Thompson concedes that the fetus is a person from the moment of conception. If her argument works to justify abortion, it works just as well to justify killing any dependent child. After all, a two-year-old makes a much greater demand on a woman than a developing unborn.","This seems to be the central argument: the article continues to give many examples of moral disapproval of neglecting or murdering your children. However, it ignores the fact that parenthood is a relationship which is not defined simplistically by genetic relation or by being in the womb (it is unclear if he thinks surrogate mothers should be able to have abortions).  We can be prosecuted for neglecting an adopted child or step-child, or anyone we have parental responsibility for. On the other hand, if a person gives their child up for adoption then they cannot be charged with negligence if the child is deserted by its new parents.  One interesting part:."

"(1416, 4)",1.142857143,"Society's willingness to impose on women alone the sacrifice required by laws restricting abortion, unique within the landscape of Anglo-American law, may well reflect a deeply held traditional view of the differences in character of the sexes. While we might not impose selflessness and virtuous behavior on a man....some may find it less of a contradiction to impose such virtue on a woman because of the traditional view of her nature. But to impose virtue on ANY person demeans that person's individual worth. It is no more acceptable when the person is a woman than a man. There should be no 'woman's exception' to our traditional regard for individualism and autonomy. As long as these values remain at the core of our legal system, there is thus a powerful case for the conclusion that laws prohibiting abortion--even IF the fetus is regarded as a person--deny women the equal protection of the laws guaranteed to all by the 14th amendment. And if this is so, then perhaps the Roe decision, by gratuitously insisting that the fetus cannot be deemed a person, needlessly insulted and alienated those for whom the view that the fetus is a person represents a fundamental article of faith or a bedrock personal committment. Perhaps as Yale Law School Dean Guido Calabresi has suggested, the Roe opinion for no good reason said to a large and politically active group ""[y]our metaphysics are not part of our Constitution.""

I think that's what Grocott was saying - that it's not definable in a precise, non controversial way so that everyone can agree on exactly what it includes and what it does not. Even the word ""phenomena"" is vague.   The reason I said (and maintain) that it's a murky combination of facts and theories is because it can branch off in different ways and follow different paths, depending on the presuppositions (worldviews) of those assigned the duty of directing it. In this case it's the teaching establishment. There is only a finite amount of instruction time in schools. Some paths get more time, attention, and detail allotted to them than do other paths."
"(1397, 2)",1,"What is science?The first place to start is with a definition of science. Many exist, but most of them come down to something like, Ã‚â€œIf something is scientific, it is observable and testable (i.e., able to be repeated).Ã‚â€ùNow it might surprise readers without a scientific background to hear me say that very few scientists have any real idea what science is. However, if you are a scientist you will probably acknowledge the truth of this seemingly nonsensical statement. In my undergraduate studies and postgraduate research, I canÃ‚â€™t ever recall anyone telling me what science is (and isnÃ‚â€™t!), showing me what it is, or providing me with an explanation of how it operates. If you are studying science or working with scientists and you doubt me, I challenge you to ask them for a definition of what is Ã‚â€œscientific.Ã‚â€ù After a pause, most of them would not be able to give an answer much deeper than Ã‚â€œIt is what scientists do.Ã‚â€ùAs an undergraduate, I was taught to remember, not to think. Sure, I was given tools which I could use to think, but I wasnÃ‚â€™t actually taught to think. Then, as a Ph.D. researcher I worked in a very narrow field (as do all Ph.D. researchers), and so the breadth of a question like Ã‚â€œWhat is the definition of scientific?Ã‚â€ù was absolutely irrelevant to me. Upon graduation and working as a research scientist for 17 years and as a leader of other scientists, the question has never arisen, nor apparently needed to have been asked. My point is that most scientists donÃ‚â€™t really know what is or isnÃ‚â€™t scientific, because it rarely affects what they do.Why make a big deal of this? The reason is because creation and evolution are actually both outside the realms of science and, to know this, you need to know what science isÃ‚â€”and as we have seen, most scientists donÃ‚â€™t.Neither Ã‚â€œprocessÃ‚â€ù is currently observable, testable or repeatable. Please note that when speaking of evolution, I am talking of the appearance of new (not rearranged) genetic information leading to greater and greater complexity of genetic information. I am also talking about the appearance of life starting from inanimate chemicals. When talking about evolution, I am not speaking of natural selection, which leads to a reduction in genetic information in those species. Creationists, of course, have not the slightest problem with natural selection. After all, it has been practiced by farmers for centuries in their breeding of plants and animals through selecting preferred offspring and mating or propagating these. Anyway, the theory of natural selection was described by creation-believing scientists long before Darwin boarded the Beagle.","http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...sd/grocott.aspSo who decides what is or isn't science? If what was taught in science classes was no more controversial than the freezing point of water or the melting point of lead, then maybe it could be defined in a way that everyone could agree on. But when it gets into theories and hypothesis about one time events that happened thousands, or billions of years ago, its time to set aside what we think science is, and ask ourselves what science class is trying to accomplish. If we take students to a theoretic area where we suspect there is more to be discovered, isn't it time to consider teaching them HOW to think, not WHAT to think? Can we do that by ruling an entire concept out, in a society that exercises free inquiry and advocates progress?

The first was said by an Englishman named Andrew Fletcher, whose work was frequently cited by our founders to justify armed resistance against British misrule in America. The second was said by a Judge in my beloved Commonwealth of Virginia:  And I cannot see, why arms should be denied to any man who is not a slave, since they are the only true badges of liberty. . . .The possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave. He who has nothing, and belongs to another, must be defended by him, and needs no arms: but he who thinks he is his own master, and has anything he may call his own, ought to have arms to defend himself and what he possesses, or else he lives precariously and at discretion. And though for a while those who have the sword in their power abstain from doing him injury; yet, by degrees, he will be awed into submission to every arbitrary command. Andrew Fletcher, Political Works, pp. 35 and 221 (1749).   The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction. Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia, in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300  There are many solid legal, moral, and practical arguments in support of private firearm ownership. Some are short, but many are long. I know quite a few of them, and I'll happily share them with you if you want some more ammo for your debate. Just let me know here.  ---  False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. They ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree. Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment, 1764  A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves, and render regular troops in a great measure unnecessary. . . .the constitution ought to secure a genuine and guard against a select militia. . .and include. . .all men capable of bearing arms. . . . But, say gentlemen, the general militia are for the most part employed at home in their private concerns, cannot well be called out, or be depended upon; that we must have a select militia. . . .[of the select militia] These Corps, not much unlike regular troops, well ever produce an inattention to the general militia. . .whereas, to preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them. . . .The mind that aims at a select militia, must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle; and when we see many men disposed to practice upon it, whenever they can prevail, no wonder true republicans are for carefully guarding against it. Richard Henry Lee, Additional Letters from the Federal Farmer, p. 169-170 (1788)  Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest. If we want the Arms Act to be repealed, if we want to learn the use of arms, here is a golden opportunity. If the middle class render voluntary help to Government in the hour of its trial, distrust will disappear, and the ban on possessing arms will be withdrawn. Ghandi, 2 M. Gandhi, An Autobiography of the Story of My Experiments with the Truth, p. 374 (M. Desai, trans. 1927).  Whenever, therefore, the profession of arms becomes a distinct order in the state. . .the end of the social compact is defeated. . . .No free government was ever founded, or ever preserved its liberty, without uniting the characters of the citizen and soldier in those destined for defense of the state. . . .Such a well regulated militia, composed of freeholders, citizens and husbandman, who take up arms to preserve their property, as individuals, and their rights as freemen.

Tyrants have never placed any confidence on a militia composed of freemen. John DeWitt, The Anti-Federalist Papers, p. 75 (M. Borden ed. 1965)  Make mass searches and hold executions for found arms. V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 35, 4th ed., p. 286. From Congressional Record, April 28, 1970, p. H3601.  If the opposition disarms, well and good. If it refuses to disarm, we shall disarm it ourselves. Joseph Stalin, Reply to the discussion on the Political Reports of the Central Committee, Dec. 7, 1927. Stalin, Works, Vol. 10, p. 378. From Congressional Record, April 28, 1970, p. H3601..  The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the supply of arms to the underdogs is a sine qua non for the overthrow of any sovereignty. So let's not have any native militia or native police. German troops alone will bear the sole responsibility for the maintenance of law and order throughout the occupied Russian territories, and a system of military strong-points must be evolved to cover the entire occupied country.

Using the argon-argon variant of K-Ar allows many cross checks for excess argon or argon loss that are invisible to standard K-Ar dating. At the very least, a better approach would be to date the rocks using individual minerals. The worst possible method would be to measure the age on an inhomogeneous whole rock sample. In the footnotes, the methods are described as follows: Whole rock' samples were analyzed in all cases-K-Ar at Activation Laboratories, Ancaster, Ontario, Canada; Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd and Pb-Pb at the PRISE Laboratory, Research School of Earth Sciences, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia. ....

They would know the best. IF the ones raped are too young such as under maybe 10 or are like seven or its a loved one and they can't seperate justice from love, then the case be decided by law.   Give them the chance to live in solitary confinement, give them the chance, we can always take it away. But those killed don't get no more chances. In prison if they do kill put them in confinement. Same with the others, if they are in solitary and they succeed in killing someone else , death penalty then fine.    But gang murders should be different, if someone is in jail for killing a gang member in a fight or something like that , it is murder but it isnt as open and as clear justice as it is if they shot a four year old in the head for being related to someone in an opposing gang. Then its wrong flat out, solitary or death penalty. Personally Id be for giving them death penalty for anyone who would do that.

Many of the beloved stories found in the Bible - the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah and the ark - convey timeless truths about God, human beings, and the proper relationship between Creator and creation expressed in the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. Religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth. Its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts.  We the undersigned, Christian clergy from many different traditions, believe that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist. We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth, one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests. To reject this truth or to treat it as ""one theory among others"" is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children. We believe that among God's good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator. To argue that God's loving plan of salvation for humanity precludes the full employment of the God-given faculty of reason is to attempt to limit God, an act of hubris. We urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge.

These experiments also introduced the microbiological method of replica plating. Max Delbruck and Salvador Luria won the 1969 Nobel Prize in part for this work. In their experiment, Luria and Delbruck inoculated a small number of bacteria into separate culture tubes. After a period of growth, they plated equal volumes of these separate cultures onto phage (virus) containing agar. If virus resistance in bacteria were caused by a spontaneous activation in bacteria, then each plate should contain the same number of resistant colonies. This, however was not what Delbruck and Luria found. Instead, the number of resistant colonies on each plate varied drastically. Luria and Delbruck proposed that these results could be explained by the occurrence of a constant rate of random mutations in each generation of bacteria growing in the initial culture tubes.

By your reasoning, it would make just as much sense to allow abortions up until the lungs develop. After all, without a healthy set of lungs, you aren't ""you."" To me, this seems ridiculous. You hit the nail on the head when you said that pro-choicers (for the most part) value the fetus less than the value of the mother's right to her own body. Pro-lifers simply see the value of these two entities as equal. Development of a brain and mind is simply a step along the process of the development of a human being. If we were to translate your reasoning onto the whole of human society, we would value people with superior intellect over those without.","I think I'm getting what you are saying here, and I sort of agree. It is both the body and the mind that make a person, and each are important. If you have one without the other- the body (very underdeveloed in this case) without the mind in the case of a foetus, it does not make a person. I do think anti-choicers value both the same, even if one exists without the other. In their case I would ask them if they value a person who was recently deceased, where the cells of the body are still living, but there is no mental existence. I also beleive you are right in saying most pro-choicers do not place as high a value on a foetus (which is not a person) as they do on the woman (who is a fully developed person). There is not as much of an empathy toward the foetus as it is not a person, and not as valuable as the woman.

According to the researchers, female bats interact mainly with other females in complex hierarchies during their lives, so that could be why they take more of an interest in echolocation sounds from their own sex.  .....She told Discovery News, ""The connection of the two studies is in the idea that bat communication is more complex than previously documented, since research is finding a variety of social calls to be communicating territory defense and mate attraction, as well as sonar calls, previously thought to only function in prey capture and navigation, to also have a communication role.""."

Major figures in the development of the modern synthesis include Thomas Hunt Morgan, R. A. Fisher, Theodosius Dobzhansky, J.B.S. Haldane, Sewall Wright, Julian Huxley, Ernst Mayr, Bernhard Rensch, George Gaylord Simpson, and G. Ledyard Stebbins.

All thanks to what they label as 'inititial conditions'. In the case of 'the big bang' they've another word for that, too, --something that call a 'singularity'. One more cute bumper-sticker that has no real meaning behind it at all.  Seen from that angle, everything that occurs in any 'system' is simply a continuation of the action of the 'drivers' involved in the 'initial conditions', no matter how protracted that action may be. The 'initial conditions' of 'the break' in a game of billiards determining exactly where each ball will end up, no matter how many ricochets it makes off rails and other balls. And so on for each shot throughout the systematized process that is the game entire.  And that is very much the view of the universe's internal systems as held by materialists today. The closed system that is the universe seen as a variation on a pool shot, i.e., ""assumed"" , 'taken for granted', initial conditions determining various dissipatory extentions in subsequents events, until 'the table' is all used up, entropically. All 'systems', be they physical or biological, as allopoietic strings of predestined and mechanically inevitable entropic outcomes.  That mentality is utterly satisfactory until it slams into a brick wall called biology. All of a sudden we have autopoietic systems where phenomena are observed that cannot be justified or rationalised in terms of 'initial conditions', nor in terms of additional external physical inputs,and allopoietic controls, but only in terms of initial and continuing psychical inputs. This does not stop true-believing materialists from trying to rationalise these psychical biological phenomena back into their mechanical mindset, however. We hear new magic words from them intead. Words like, 'epiphenomena' and 'emergence'. More euphemisms for 'spontaneous generation', aka, 'creatio ex nihilo, ab nihilo'. Aka, 'magick'. Materialism, and the darwinism it spawned, is an extremely superstitious mindset.","But here I slam into my own brick wall, one which neatly intersects my path down your chain of reasoning. Biological systems are simply orders of magnitude more complex than any other chemical processes because they are , by definition, autocatalytic-with-errors systems, which is a giant leap in terms of potential, in terms of the variety of future system-states that can be generated. But it is still possible to model these system-state trajectories in terms of probability, which is where chaos theory and emergence come in.  To bring myself to a close, I return to my original point. The concept 'emergence' is a human-imposed concept that can be easily described, if you so wish, as new information arising in a system ex nihilo. But it is equally easily (and more precisely) described as a rearrangent of a system's information in a way that is specifically unpredictable. That is what emergence is. There is no 'energy' created ex nihilo. There is no 'matter' created ex nihilo. The only thing that seems to be created ex nihilo is that sudden realisation within the human mind that the patterns of information have drastically changed in a way that redefines the entire system. This is why maths is essential, because the maths shows that the system has merely been reorganised, albeit radically.  It is such radical restructuring of information that I suspect gives rise to apparent consciousness. As I have said before, I do not deny consciousness, and I do prefer to think that it is real. But I do not assume that it is anything but apparent when I am making analytical judgements, and I cannot begin to imagine how you come to the conclusion that organisms such as bacteria possess it when they specifically, are quite obviously and evidently, no more than fiendishly complex micromachinery. With mammals it's another story."

But the belief that 'its gotten us far' is itself a 'scientific' type belief, in fact it has less proof on the empirical assumptions than the science itself.

If the world did not exist or did not run by the theories and laws presented by science, you would think that there would be SOME experience at SOME point in reliably recordeable human history that people had which would have shown this. Experience is the only interaction we have with existence. If some aspect of existence exists (ex. some hypothetical parallel universe) that never manifests itself in human experience then we have no way of knowing its existence. We can guess but our guesses, not being based on experience, are completely arbitrary. Given that there are a nearly infinite number of imaginary scenarios that we can think up, the probability of the reality of any of those scenarious is miniscule.  One other point: Say that the laws of physics (which are derived from mutual human experience) are wrong but just appear to be right and that some omnipotent being can change them whenever he likes. If these apparent laws have remained the same for all of recorded human time, then why should we suspect that they may change at any moment?

I suppose one important point is whether feathers were a characteristic feature of all Coelurosauria at the time when the chinese specimens date from or if they were limited to those group that were directly ancestral to the birds.  If they were a diverse trait, then its more likely that feathers featured in T. Rex's ancestry. However, even if this were the case it would instantly mean that T. Rex was feathered itself- there is a great period of time over which such a trait could have been modified or lost entirely.

"(897, 4)",0.5,"Assault weapons? first of all, what are assault weapons? Traditionally, it has meant a selective fire weapon (one capable of full, burst, and semi-automatic fire.) According to current legal definition, though, a semiautomatic weapon (one that fires a single round with every time you pull the trigger) can be legally called an assault weapon if it has 1) a removeable magazine, and any 2 of the following:   a grenade launcher a bayonet lug a pistol grip or a folding stock.   How is that an assault weapon?? I have no idea! why are they worried about semi-autos with pistol grips and folding stocks? Again, I have no idea.   However, we'll assume for the moment that we are talking about a traditional assault rifle: a selective fire weapon along the lines of the FN FAL, the M16, AK-47, etc.  Constitutionally, it doesn't even really matter. In the United States Constitution, we are guaranteed in the 2nd Amendment that:  ""... the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.""  There's a key word there. ""Infringed."" What does that word infringed mean? Webster's 1828 Dictionary defines it like this:   2. To break; to violate; to transgress; to neglect to fulfill or obey; as to infringe the law. 3. to destroy or hinder; as, to infringe efficacy.  Under this definition, the right to own a firearm cannot even be hindered! Forget banning handguns. Forget banning assault weapons. The registration of firearms might not survive a Constitutional attack.   So. It is UNCONSTITUTIONAL to ban assault weapons. (despite the fact that we basically have already done that.).","Thanks Patriot for the well researched response.  Although I am not a gun rights advocate, I am also not anti-gun and in the spirit of trying to get the two sides of this issue to reach some sort of understanding, here is what I believe to be the major points of those who support a ban on assult weapons.  First of all, I do agree that the definition of assult weapons is a little strange, and it essentially boils down to the guns that look scary.  However, the spirit of the law was to try to ban weapons whose main purpose was militaristic in nature. That is, guns that are able to be fired rapidly, have a large magazine, and reasonable stopping power. Thus, although the ban would not eliminate all of the ""dangerous"" weapons ( I assume that an M1, the rifle that beat the Nazis, would be legal) it does cover a lot of them.  Of course, most 2nd amendment rights supporters would say that all this doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what purpose the gun serves, it is unconstitutional to infringe upon the rights of Americans to own any gun they want, no matter the purpose.  What gun control advocates would say, however, is that the constitution says 'arms' not guns, and it becomes the job of the goverment to determine what was meant my this. I think that most gun control advocates would agree that the second amendment probably did not intend for people to be able to buy chemical or biological weapons, for example. And, I for one, hope that is not what they meant, particularly in light of the recent war on terrorism.  A common remark is ""why would it matter if I had a nuclear weapon if I am a law abiding citizen and would never use it against my neighbor?"" The problem is that we don't know what the intention of everyone is, and there are certainly terrorists in this country now who are American citizens and would use such powerful weapons against usif they were able to acquire them.  Of course a semi-automatic .223 caliber rifle is not the same as a chemical weapon, but the point is that (I think) most people don't think that you should be able to own absolutely any weapon that you want, so one must attempt to define what is too dangerous for ordinary citizens to own.   I don't think that I covered all of your points, Patriot, but this is getting long, so I will cut this off here, and I hope to get a response from you. I will be interested in your thoughts.  -Dan."

It expires this year.  The right to own arms is expressly clear. It shall not be infringed by Congress. The federal government is fully empowed to keep arms away from convicted fellons, it does not have the power to limit them from citizens.  Those people who ""you don't know (what they may do)""? When the government is effective enough to prevent crime or has the power to do so, then we no longer live in a free society. Keep in mind that free choice also allows a person to decide to break the law. It cuts both ways, you can not take away the choice to break laws and allow good citizens truely be free. The only governments through history that have been effective in crime prevention has been tyranically communist countries with extensive secret police. The present people in former communist block countries today are sad to see thier streets full of crime, they recall ""back in the day"" how safe it way to walk down dark streets in saftey. Yes they were safe from criminals, they were not safe from the secret police. The moment the secret police eyed you for real or imagined statistical probability of breaking a crime or become a political enemy, you dissapeared and no one ever saw you alive again.  The WMD analogy is poor. You will not find any vendors. Please find another one. There may be Constitutionally poor arguments in favor of banning WMDs for civilians, that argument is moot. You will not find any vendor. The Constitution protects my right to own arms. That does not mean arms vendors must be forced to sell thier product to me if I want one. That argument is moot.  The Firearms Act decided that sawed off shot guns and the Thompson machine gun is to be banned from civilian ownership. Early Supreme court DECISIONS support this. Early judicial opinion of the the Firearms act was based on the fact that the Thompson and sawed off shot gun was not a military serviceable weapon and does not apply to the 2nd Amendment. The Thompson and sawed off shotgun were not used by the US Army. Guess what? The Thompson was adpoted by the Army a few years later. So then, what does that mean? Judicial opinion is of the direction that military serviceable weapons are protected by the 2nd Amendment. What does that mean for the assault rifle ban? It means it is on shakey Constitutional ground.  Some points I have for you:  1) Flash supressor? Argued by anti-gunners prevent shooters from hiding thier position.  Completely false. Flash hiders can hide flash from the target. It's main purpose is to hide flash from the SHOOTER! The flash startles the shooter and makes bullets ballistically unstable:  ""Excessive muzzle flash happens when unburned powder ignites at the muzzle, causing turbulence behind the bullet with a detrimental effect on accuracy."" - http://www.shootingsoftware.com/loadens.htm  Flash has more to do with the ammo than the attachment on the end. The Flash hidder ban has lowered target shooting scores more than protecting lives.  2) Magazine limit? Argued by anti-gunners to save lives. Argued to prevent rapid and large expendature of rounds down range upon victims. True, but how often do you hear that? When it does happen it is national news. The real threat is from guns that contain more 2 less than 4 bullets:  http://ip.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/2/151  The anti-gunners know this and are comming after your 6 shot revolvers next. They just wanted people to started getting used it to idea of banning bullet capacity.  So then. The ban on more than 10 bullets? It really does not do anything than give a false sense of security. If public policy productive and actally do something, then the ban on 10 bullets is a farce.  3) Bayonet? I can not even fathom a reason to ban them other than emotional reasons. Simly because they look dangerous I suppose is why they are banned. Will someone please let me know? Public policy should not be based on emotional reasons to be truely good and effective policy.  4) Pistol grip? They make controling an automatic weapon easier to sight on your target. Well then, if you rifle is semi-auto, then what reason is there to ban them?"

The answer of course, is politics. Science has become more and more politicized as the domestic federal government grows larger and larger. The government that once had limited powers has become more and more discoverers of emergencies and crisies, that entitle us all, particularly organizations, to a share of federal pie. Science has gladly hopped on board - they have the measuring devices, the microscopes and telescopes.   In 1989, the budget of the National Institutes of Health was $7.9 billion.

Of course, some say that religion peddles the same thing. Science would rather not compete with it, and it certainly doesn't help when the new concept of ID, armed with the latest scientific discoveries, comes along questioning established scientific ""theories"" that keep them at the highest rung of the hope and fear ladder.

It is what it is, regardless of how it is perceived or labeled. If you think it's acceptable as the 'right to choose' -- good for you! If you abhor it as 'murdering innocent children' -- good for you! I am posting this information because it is something that I discovered recently while investigating various methods of birth control... And I believe that many people are not aware of the information I communicate here. I wasn't. Take it for whatever it's worth. If the issue is important to you for any reason, I encourage you to do some research on the subject.) The answer depends on the definition of 'abortion.' According to currently accepted medical terms, 'pregnancy' does not begin until the point of implantation of the embryo in the uterine wall. And 'abortion' is the termination of a pregnancy. So, according to the currently accepted medical terminology, the answer is no, of course not!  However, if you define 'abortion' as the termination of a physical entity that has been developing since the point of fertilization, then there is significant evidence to suggest that the answer is yes. And absolutely no evidence to suggest that the answer is no.  The birth control pill has three primary functions (as do most hormonal bc agents):  1. The primary function of the pill is to prevent ovulation, but sometimes ovulation occurs while on the pill.  2. A secondary function of the pill is to slow sperm down so that they do not reach the ovum in order to fertilize it, but sometimes the sperm does reach the ovum in time to fertilize it. 3. The third function of birth control pills is to create a less hospitable environment for a fertilized egg to implant in the uterus, but sometimes the fertilized egg does implant in the uterine wall, as evidenced by a 'failure rate' when women are on the pill. (In other words, sometimes women get pregnant while on the pill, indicating that all three functions of the pill failed.)  It is widely recognized by pill manufacturers and within the medical/scientific community that the effects of the pill can and sometimes do arrest the development of a human embryo that has not yet implanted itself into the uterine wall by 'creating a less hospitable environment for the embryo.' How often this happens is uncertain (some estimates are as high as 50% while some estimates suggest percentages in the low single digits), but there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that it can and does happen.  Your physician may or may not be aware of this. Ask her/him if you are concerned. Your physician also may assert that birth control pills do not cause 'abortions' because according to accepted medical terminology, pregnancy doesn't begin until implantation. While I do not personally believe abortion is 'wrong,' some people DO believe it is wrong. If you do believe that abortion (as in terminating the development of an entity after conception) then you may logically also have to believe that using the pill for birth control is wrong as it may lead to an abortion prior to implantation.  Hope this is helpful information! The Bootfitter.","I know that sometimes when a woman is on the pill, and they happen to get pregnant anyways, it will cause you to miscarry (not always, but sometimes). Usually it happens very early in the pregnancy before they realize they are even pregnant. But I don't know if I would call that abortion as in the way the term is normally used, because the woman isn't terminating the pregnancy on purpose, although miscarriage is called 'spontanious abortion'.. I also remember hearing from a friend of mine, who is Catholic, that in her church any type of birth control is considered wrong.. I'm not sure on that though, since I'm not Catholic myself."

I do think however, that wanted pregnancies should be a part of the abortion debate, even though as you say, they usually are not.

Ancient life can never be observed in its living state- all we have are the remains of these creatures in the form of fossils. As we can position these remains in time using stratigraphy and radiometric dating we can see what their relative temporal positions were. By comparing similar forms we can see how a descendant differs from its ancestor so we can determine how the structure of that line changed with time.

If you're talking about the origins of life, many evolutionists believe in abiogenesis - that life somehow just came about out of non-life.  Some will say that evolution and abiogenesis are two distinct theories, but there's a lot of cross-over; begun with Charles Darwin himself who postulated a primordial soup. Miller-Urey did experiments to try to concoct how life began in a primordial soup of their own design. They failed in essence to demonstrate how life could emerge from non-life through natural means. (Many work on the philosophy that life came about and evolved through naturalistic, or materialistic processes)  It leads people such as Nobel-winner Francis Crick to come up with certain strange notions; Panspermia, of which, his version just shifts the problem, rather than answers it. (see below under PANSPERMIA)  Intelligent Design theorists suggest that some intelligence; possibly, but not exclusively a deity is behind nature; that nature seems to have an order. Some here too casually dismiss ID from science but the door's already open to science SETI looks for ID Cryptographers do to Forensic scientists do  THEORIES OF LIFE... PANSPERMIA Panspermia is the idea that life came from outer space. As with all theories this too is not homogenous. There's a general panspermia theory, and a 'directed' panspermia theory. The former is a belief that life came here by random chance, such as on a meteor. The later is that life came here at the behest of an intelligence - such as aliens directing ships to earth laden with the molecules of life.  One idea is that the building blocks of life ""...Bakes said nitrogenated aromatics exist throughout the Milky Way galaxy."" http://www.spacedaily.com/news/life-04zw.html  ""Francis Crick also thinks that life on earth may have begun when aliens from another planet sent a rocket ship containing spores to seed the earth. This is no idle thought; Crick first proposed it with chemist Leslie Orgel in 1973 in an article entitled ""Directed Panspermia"" in a professional science journal called Icarus. A decade later Crick wrote a book, Life Itself, reiterating the theory; in a 1992 interview in Scientific American on the eve of the publication of his latest book, Crick reaffirmed that he things the theory is reasonable."" (Behe, M, ""Darwin's Black Box"", p238) which as I said, simply moves the problem to 'where did the aliens come from?'  ""COMPLEXITY THEORY  Stuart Kauffman, a theoretical biologist at the Sante Fe Institute, has put forth the idea that when the necessary elements of the cell formed in the primordial soup (nucleotides, lipids, and amino acids), they were instantaneously integrated into a system, a system which we know as the cell (Cohen, 1996). Kauffman says this was not due to a miracle or chance, but was bound to occur. He rejects other scientists' need to find some sort of genetic carrier like RNA or DNA, or even an aperiodic solid, saying that the life forms may have had no need for them. (An aperiodic solid is one in which the atoms are arranged in some non-repeatable geometric pattern, such as a helix, that would allow for the variation within the structure that is necessary for genetic material). He believes that such genetic carriers could have evolved after the new life was already flourishing. Kauffman has even designed a computer model that shows that when a few organic molecules have developed some catalytic skills and reach the necessary level of diversity, then they spontaneously form an ""autocatalytic set"" (a life form). His theory is based on the general complexity theory, which states that when a system reaches some critical level of complexity, it will naturally produce a degree of complex order (4)."" http://www.lifesci.utexas.edu/cours...2/JENNIFER.html  A. G. Cairns-Smith's Callisto Theory: That life began from a type of living-clay Richard Dawkins says of this ""Cairns-Smith believes that the original life on this planet was based on self-replicating inorganic crystals such as silicates. If this is true, organic replicators, and eventually DNA, must later have taken over or usurped the role."" http://originoflife.net/cairns_smith/  ""Other Theories In spite of the intense level of work on the RNA world in the last decade, there is no true consensus theory for precellular life. There are many theories. Here are some of the others ? A few scientists still say that DNA could succeed in starting life on its way (11). But even the shortest DNA strand needs proteins to help it replicate. This is the chicken-and-egg problem.  There is a ""proteins first"" school. For example, Manfred Eigen of Germany's Max Planck Institute says, ""There is no doubt that proteins, which are more easily formed, were first on the scene"" (11.5). Of course, these first proteins must be much shorter than any used in life today, because of the sheer unlikelihood of forming useful long ones out of a soup of amino acids.  Physicist Freeman Dyson proposes to solve the chicken-and-egg problem with a double origin, one for metabolism (proteins) and one for replication (strands of nucleotides) (12).  In Seven Clues to the Origin of Life (13), A. G. Cairns-Smith says that clay crystals could have served as the scaffolding upon which the first short DNA or RNA genome was constructed. A new elaboration of this idea prompted one writer to wonder, ""Primordial soup or crÃªpes?"" (14). Even more recently, another tangent on this path leads to zeolite (14.5).  Biologists Harold J. Morowitz (15), David Deamer (16), and others (17), advocate a theory that could be paraphrased as ""containers first.""  Jeffrey L. Bada of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography holds the minority view that the early Earth was frozen and believes precellular life started in ""cold soup"" under the ice (18, 19).  Chemists Claudia Huber and GÃ_nter WÃ_chtershÃ_user say the soup where life originated was actually quite hot, probably, near undersea volcanic vents, where iron and nickel sulfides might catalyze some of the necessary reactions (19.5-19.7).  Cornell Astronomer Thomas Gold wonders if life might have originated in a hot environment even deeper, in Earth's crust (19.8).  Stuart Kauffman of the Santa Fe Institute, says, ""...whenever a collection of molecules contains enough different kinds of molecules, a metabolism will crystallize from the broth"" (20).  Another idea is the ""PNA world."" Because starting the RNA world is so difficult, there probably needs to be a pre-RNA world. PNA, or peptide nucleic acid, might have some of the properties necessary to constitute that world (21). This would be pre-precellular life."" http://www.panspermia.org/rnaworld.htm    ADDENDUM  If you're interested in aliens, check out ""The Science of Aliens"" by Clifford A. Pickover.

"(1130, 1)",0.6,"This is a very fundamental difference how anti-gunners view the 2nd Amendment and the nature of rights. They think of the Bill of Rights as a 'permission slip', the view the text as proof that the government gives us rights. The government does nothing of that sort, the Bill of Rights as a document declares that government is FORBIDEN to grab power over the issuses and rights mentioned in the Bill of Rights.","Well I replied to this same post a couple months ago, but I would like to respond with a new perspective I have on it now.  Basically the basics of the US government is that it is to secure our rights and our safety, so that we don't live in a state of anarchy, where the biggest strongest man wins. If a power isn't given to the government, they may not use it. The bill of rights is an even further prohibition of regulation. To make a law based on firearms or anything they have to have a reason for doing it, and the federal government may not be involved unless the Constitution grants them the right to (it doesn't mention guns in the powers it gives the US government). The 2nd amendment is restricting the government (federal, states, and local governments) from infringing upon that right. But the question still arises, what is meant by the mysterious militia clause?  There are many interpreations on this but I think the basic meaning of this is so that a similar thing could happen as did in the American revolution. But then an even bigger problem arises. If that purpose is to be left intact we need to allow the citizens to access the same weapons the government has. But I really don't feel comfortable allowing citizens with atomic bombs and such. This is really a problem. Also, obviously if this were meant to be a tool for a revolution, wouldn't concealed weapons also be covered? Again it seems that it is currently impossible to follow the intentions of the amendment.  Many will use the quote ""Those that sacrifice liberty for safety deserve neither"", but this is a hollow argument. The whole purpose of government is that we give up some of our natural liberties (the liberty to kill someone) for personal safety and protection of our other rights (the right to life). I agree you cannot go too far, but where do we draw the line? I don't like the idea of an oppressive government owning all the weapons or do I want them available to the worst criminals, so that instead of handguns and regular bombs, they are using uzies and atomic bombs? Do you have more trust in the government or in the general public? That's a hard question to answer because I don't have much trust in either one, therefor I seem to be undecided on where to really draw the line.

The Constitutional Court ordered that parliament amend marriage laws to allow gay weddings within a year.   The constitution outlaws discrimination against gays and lesbians, but social attitudes remain more conservative.   The court ordered that the definition of marriage be changed from a ""union between a man and a woman"" to a ""union between two persons"".   Last year, the Supreme Court of Appeal had ruled in a case brought by a lesbian couple that the current law discriminated against homosexuals.   But the home affairs department went to the Constitutional Court, arguing that only parliament could change the law.   ""The common law definition of marriage is declared to be inconsistent with the constitution and invalid to the extent that it does not permit same-sex couples to enjoy the status and benefits it accords heterosexual couples,"" said Justice Albie Sachs in his ruling, AFP reports.   After the Supreme Court of Appeal ruled last November that Marie Fourie and Cecilia Bonthuys should be allowed to wed, they later found they were unable to register for a church wedding at the Department of Home Affairs.   Keketso Maema, a lawyer for the Lesbian and Gay Equality project, said he was disappointed that the Constitutional Court did not order the immediate legalisation of gay marriages.   ""It's a bit disappointing. It feels like it's one step forward and still another one step backwards,"" he told Reuters news agency.

"(1312, 6)",0.833333333,Are rights a useful framework at all?,"Yes. A proper understanding of rights is neccessary to know when you are aggressing against another person. Most children learn about rights intuitively through social interaction, a child take's another child's toy ""That's mine"", they say, they may fight over it, but they learn that when people lay contrary claims to things, violent conflict is the result.  It is useful to refine this intuitive belief system into something consistent, both individually, and in shaping the law of a society. A society in which people work together through trade and friendship will always be more prosperous and safe than one in which rights are systematically ignored and violent conflict is the norm.  It is not useful to talk about rights with people who treat them as subjective, based on value judgements, ie ""People have a right to life, because life is more valuable than being able to have an abortion"", or ""People have a right to have an abortion, because being able to have an abortion is more important than a fetus"". There is nothing to debate, we may as well go over whether strawberry or chocolate is a better flavour for a milkshake. In a free society we can disagree over what is ""more important"" and make our own choices, but if value judgements are used to determine law, the only possible outcome is the oppression of those with minority values.  No argument can be made about value judgements, they do not convince anyone, they do not provide just solutions. Politically, to demand your values be enforced (by virtue of your political power) is to demand the rule of force rather than justice.  There are only two choices: The rule of law, justice, a free society, built on the moral foundation of individual rights - or the rule of the majority, built on the arbitrary value judgements and preferences of those weilding power."

(Link on an above post.)   ...the costs of creating, maintaining, and using a federal system are likely to be substantial. The projected costs of the system must be weighed against the potential to reduce the enormous social and economic costs associated with gun violence. Eighty lives per day-almost 29,000 per year-are lost to gun violence in the United States.16 The social costs of gun violence in the United States have been estimated to be an extraordinary $100 billion per year.17 If ballistic fingerprinting laws result in significant reductions in gun violence- by strengthening law enforcement efforts to identify and prosecute violent offenders and deterring illegal gun use by and transfers to criminals and youth-the investment will be well worth it.   Also,  -In 1994, the lifetime medical costs associated with firearm injuries and deaths totaled $2.3 billion. - Approximately 49% of the costs of gun-related injuries and deaths is paid by the public. -The hospitalization costs associated with firearm-related injuries in 1997 exceeded $800 million. -Thirty percent (30%) of hospitalized patients were uninsured, and an additional 30% were enrolled in government health insurance programs. -The direct costs (e.g., medical, productivity) and social costs (e.g., quality of life, emotional) of gun violence are an estimated $100 billion per year   Like I have, said, it seems that perhaps not enough research has been done, to figure out precisely what the program will cost, and how how effective it would be. But I am suprised that there are those who seem so set against even considering such a program, when it appears that there may be a substantial benefit."

Most people can't be trusted, so we should have laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.  28. The right of Internet pornographers to exist cannot be questioned because it is constitutionally protected by the Bill of Rights, but the use of handguns for self defense is not really protected by the Bill of Rights.  29. Free speech entitles one to own newspapers, transmitters, computers, and typewriters, but self-defense only justifies bare hands.  30. The ACLU is good because it uncompromisingly defends certain parts of the Constitution, and the NRA is bad, because it defends other parts of the Constitution.  31. Charlton Heston, a movie actor as president of the NRA is a cheap lunatic who should be ignored, but Michael Douglas, a movie actor as a representative of Handgun Control, Inc. is an ambassador for peace who is entitled to an audience at the UN arms control summit.  32. Police operate with backup within groups, which is why they need larger capacity pistol magazines than do ""civilians"" who must face criminals alone and therefore need less ammunition.  33. We should ban ""Saturday Night Specials"" and other inexpensive guns because it's not fair that poor people have access to guns too.  34. Police officers have some special Jedi-like mastery over hand guns that private citizens can never hope to obtain.  35. Private citizens don't need a gun for self-protection because the police are there to protect them even though the Supreme Court says the police are not responsible for their protection.  36. Citizens don't need to carry a gun for personal protection but police chiefs, who are desk-bound administrators who work in a building filled with cops, need a gun.  37.

When Microsoft pressures its distributors to give Microsoft preferential promotion, that's bad; but when the Federal government pressures cities to buy guns only from Smith & Wesson, that's good.  39.

It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.""

God seems to undergo a radical personality shift between the OT and the NT, from a God of smiting to a God of love and tolerance. Which part are we to listen to? Do Paul's letters carry the same weight as the Gospel? I'd have alot of questions.  I guess how much I'd change my life depends on how forthcoming God is. Is the only thing we've learned what you've spelled out? God exists, Genesis is correct?

The mere fact that a God exists does not, in my opinion, mean He is worthy of worship or following. God does alot of stuff in the OT that seems unjustifiable to be, and I'm not willing to let things slide just becuase someone claims ineffability. So I guess I would still lead my life as best as I could, according to the standards I've developed. At least, that would be my intention. Knowing that God was in fact watching and judging me might, for example, put a damper on my support of gay rights. I'd feel like a coward, but it could happen.

All though it is a very long way to the closest star we really don't know how far stars are away from us it is not possible to know. It is an educated guess at best.

How gravity affects light in space in pure specualtion as almost all of the cosmological theories are. Black holes were created to explain the big bang. There are lots of astonomers that are convinced the big bang is a myth.  If the stars were created near the earth and then streched out as the Bible says they were the relationship of time and distance would be quite different and would explain how light from a distant star could be seen.

WARD: Well, Let's talk about the information that  you have.   FLYNT: Well, we've been doing an investigation for  a little over eight months to the effect that an  abortion took place in 1970 in Houston, Texas.  He was working for his father's campaign when he  was running for the senate against Lloyd Bentsen,  and a fellow by the name of Robert Chandler was  the campaign manager. He got a girl pregnant during  this period of time, and she had an abortion. We've  been able to locate the doctor who performed  the procedure (unintelligible) hospital in Houston.  Not only that but we have the affidavits from four  of her friends stating that they knew about the  affair, the pregnancy and the subsequent abortion.

Whether she was afraid or  whether she was paid off, I don't really want to  speculate, because I don't know what the actual  reason was. But when I started taking this to the  mainstream media, I said you don't have to break  the story, just ask the question, you know.

No one would touch  it.   WARD: As of now, the woman who you know denies that  she had the abortion?   FLYNT: No, no, no. She doesn't deny that. We know  she had the abortion. We know she was Bush's  girlfriend at the time. This was in the 1970's,  he would have been in his twenties at the time.  But she does not want to come out. The last  conversation my investigators had with her, she  said I don't have anything bad to say about  George W. And they said, well, how about  when he did not come to visit you in the  hospital when you had the abortion, didn't  that upset you? So she got very upset and  irate because I took that line of questioning,  and said, you know, I am not going to talk  to you anymore about this issue.   WARD: But when your investigators talked to this  woman, did she ever say to them that you guys are  wrong, I never had the abortion.

FLYNT: Yes, and we have this guy, Robert Chandler,  who I said was George Bush's campaign manager at  the time, his girlfriend is one of our key sources  on this story who actually accompanied the girl who  had the abortion to the hospital.   WARD: Were abortions legal in Texas at this time?   FLYNT: No, that was before Roe versus Wade and that  makes it a crime.

As I mentioned in a previous post, without further criterion, ""survival of the fittest"" is a tautology. But Darwin did offer further criterion in chapter after chapter years before he acquiesced to use the phrase. Certainly Montalban has read ""Origin"" since he quotes it. How is it that he missed chapter 2? How is it that he failed to understand Darwin's meaning in chapter 1?  But I will concede that ""Origin"" is not an easy read. Understanding requires a command of English beyond the ordinary, as well as an understanding of biological science at a graduate level. Darwin was not addressing a popular audience, even though his book became popular. Darwin was addressing the naturalist of his day - what came to be called biologists in our day. English grammar and usage has evolved since Darwin's day and biology has advanced. When one considers the importance to evolutionary theory of what Darwin said (even without the misunderstandings of the uneducated), it is a matter of historical significance only. Darwin's theories have been supported or falsified many times over. For the most part, his theories have been supported. He was wrong on some minor points.

Unfortunately there are people that make false facts on the availability of such things as adoption. Some of the facts on this issue are available at: http://www.ncfa-usa.org  (I am including a link to this American site because i think most of you reading this are American) A common misconception about pro-lifers is that they're women-hating. This is a misconception put out by feminist groups that support abortion, the truth is there are many female pro-lifers, my pro-life group at the University of Waterloo actually consists mainly of women, sadly this may be due to the fact that women tend to care about others much more than men, affirming my above statement about caring about the children.","I know that not all people who are pro-life are woman-hating. I, too want to see abortion reduced to the bare minimum. I just disagree with most pro-lifers on how to accomplish that.   My issue was with ROCC's attitude in the post I was responding to. To summarize he/she said that your shouldn't get pregnant and if you do - you just get to deal with it. There is absolutely no regard for an individual's situation, the attack is entirely focused on women and it offers NOTHING that will help reduce abortion.  ROCC's statement was quite woman-hating, but no, it is not indicative of the pro-life side's feelings about women. The only times I am compelled to really think pro-lifers are anti-woman is when they have the ""pregnancy is a woman's due punishment for promiscuity"" attitude or demand that a woman die/put her health jeapardy or demand rape victims go through with pregnancies. If you can't see the woman in even those most extreme situations, then you clearly have zero regard for women.  I believe that abortion stands it best chance at being reduced by addressing the things that lead to unplanned pregnancy and the reasons women choose to abort. To demonize women and simply take away choice without addressing these things will not reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, or gauarantee responsible choices. It will lead desperate women to desperate action, though (i.e., coat hangers)."

McGinn feels atheism can often be a ""quick fix"" for students who are still searching or need a way to declare their independence.

According to McGinn, most people who claim to be atheists are probably agnostic, or people who do not believe God's existence can be proved either way.

I know it's a bit unusual in a public forum but I'd like to introduce a little personal history here by way of illustration of my path to atheism: I was educated during my most impressionable years (11-18) at a grammar school controlled by the Jesuits. All my teachers were priests and many were of formidable intellect. Every morning began with ""divine service"", every lesson was started and ended with a prayer. At noon we sang the Angelus and at 3.30 in the afternoon we finished the school day with Benediction. We had at least one session a day learning and reciting the catechism - so we could be word perfect in our answers to metaphysical questions. Yet all this religious conditioning failed to arouse any spark of faith in me. Sure, I conformed to all outward appearances, but inwardly I rebelled and I did not believe. So why didn't I believe - because my clergymen teachers gave me no REASONS to do so. When, eventually, during my last days at school I chose to reveal my disbelief - the Rector said, ""Well, after all, faith is a gift from God !"" , and I had received no such gift.  Since, in my view, there is no reasoned evidence for God's existence, why succumb to wish-fulfillment ? It's less comforting but more honest to be an atheist."

Part of the abortion issue (and the most important part, IMO) is the perception of pregnancy itself. If society moves in a direction where having a baby is looked upon as a negative thing, this is not good. One way to help make abortion rarer is to help people view having a baby as a positive thing. As Clinton himself once said, abortion should be rare.","I would also like to see women choose and want to have their babies instead of terminating their pregnancies, as long as they are able to handle the responsibilities of having a baby or are able to handle the possibility of passing on those responsibilities to someone else - via adoption, having a relative bring it up, etc. Though I haven't experienced it myself, I can well imagine that having a child can be a wonderful experience. However, I believe that there are many instances where having a baby would pose very grave difficulties. Some of these might include:  - The woman might not be able to financially afford to have another child. This may be a parent who already has too many mouths to feed and would reduce the health and life opportunities of the other children if she had more children. It may be a young single woman of poor job prospects who may have no recourse but to fall back on welfare, whereas, if she waited to have children until she would be older and more prepared, she could be a better mother to those future children.  - The community in which the woman lives might be extremely negative about unmarried woman having children so both she and the baby would suffer that stigma, whereas, if she secretly got an abortion, she could maintain her reputation and have children in marriage later on in a much better social environment.  - Of course, there are the cases of rape, incest and a threat to the life of the mother, but I think we mostly agree on those.  I think that women are generally able to decide for themselves when it would be too hard for them to have a baby, so I believe that women should have the right to choose (at least during the first and second trimester) - especially since it is her body that is so intimitely involved in the process.   Yes, theoretically, they could put the child up for adoption, but giving a child up for adoption poses many difficulties for the woman, including the stigma and guilt associated with giving up a child. I applaud those women who are able to handle that stigma and give another couple the opportunity to adopt her baby, but I would not dream of forcing her into that decision. Unfortunately, though a lot of progress has been made in recent decades, there is still some social stigma left against those who give up children for adoption and against those who choose single motherhood (marriage is not always a possibility) . Reduce that stigma and you might reduce the number of abortions."

"(433, 4)",-0.8,Where did the dirt come from?,"Well, the short version is that shortly after the big bang, the universe was filled by a hot quark plasma. As it expanded and cooled, the process of nucleosynthesis produced the primordial elemental abundance, primarily hydrogen, with some deutirium, helium, and lithium. The physics is well understood, and verified by observation. Quantifying uncertainties in primordial nucleosynthesis without Monte Carlo simulations   At roughly a billion years of age, stars and galaxies formed, some fraction of the stars that formed were massive supergiants, that burned up their hydrogen into other elements, up to the atomic number of iron. This occurred at a tremendous rate and in a few more billion years, these stars went supernova and exploded. Prior to going supernova, these stars go through a phase where the outer layers of the star are shed, providing ways to transport the lighter elements away from the star. You can see this in the following link: Hubble Chemically Analyzes the Ring around Supernova 1987A   The trememdous radiation of the supernova permits the formation of elements with atomic numbers higher than iron. The force of these explosions scattered the newly created elements, creating vast gas and dust clouds. Eventually, the shockwave of another explosion initiated the collapse of one of these clouds, and the spinning hydrogen cloud begins to heat , eventually initiating nuclear fusion, and becoming our sun. As the sun began to increase it's heat output, the volatile remains of the accretion disk are driven away from the inner portion of the solar system, leaving mostly heavy elments. Comets bombarded the inner solar system, transporting water, carbon, and amino acids to the newly forming earth, making dirt.  In short, a truely wonderful creation."

If we cannot make and enforce common sense gun control laws that both sides can agree on, neither side will ever stop. If a buy back was ever proposed in America, very few guns would be sold.

Typicaly, creationists claim that they don't oppose science but only evolution - and by that they mean cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, planetary physics, biochemistry, geology, most of physics (relativity, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics), genetics, molecular biology, population genetics, embryology (evo-devo), paleontology, paleoanthropology, and on and on. What is not opposed is trivial and limited that data upon which scientific theory is built, not the theories.  So to answer the question can religion and evolution co-exist? Without question. Evolutionary scientists do not study matters outside the domain of science. Science is naturalistic - methodological naturalism - and cannot observe and study the supernatural. The supernatural cannot be quantified. I have yet to see an equation that represents the power of God. That is not to claim that things outside of science do not exist or are not valid and important. It is just that science is not the proper tool for the study of such matters. Questions of faith and morals fall in other domains - theology and religion, for example.  Can creationism and science co-exist? Probably not. But the problem is not with science. It is with creationism. Creationism establishes its conclusions before any evidence is examined based on ""divine revelation."" The problem arises when science, without regard to religion, uses the scientific method to arrive at conclusions that cannot be reconciled with creationist conclusions. This makes science the evil work of Satan, and it means that scientists are trying to escape responsibility to a god based on primitive mythology."

The Founding Fathers made it clear that the Militia was composed of the populace at large. Both the Congress and Supreme Court have affirmed this definition of the Militia.   1. Founding Fathers  * George Mason: ""I ask, who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers.""145   * Virginia Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 13 (1776): ""That a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free State; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty....""   * Richard Henry Lee: ""To preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them .... The mind that aims at a select militia [like the National Guard], must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle.""146   2. U.S. Congress   * The Militia Act of 1792. One year after the Second Amendment was added to the Constitution, Congress passed a law defining the militia. The Militia Act of 1792 declared that all free male citizens between the ages of 18 and 44 were to be members of the militia. Furthermore, every citizen was to be armed. The Act stated:   ""Every citizen... [shall] provide himself with a good musket, or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints....""147  The Militia Act of 1792 made no provision for any type of select militia such as the National Guard.   * U.S. Senate Subcommittee Report (1982). ""In the Militia Act of 1792, the second Congress defined 'militia of the United States' to include almost every free adult male in the United States. These persons were obligated by law to possess a [military-style] firearm and a minimum supply of ammunition and military equipment.... There can be little doubt from this that when the Congress and the people spoke of the a 'militia,' they had reference to the traditional concept of the entire populace capable of bearing arms, and not to any formal group such as what is today called the National Guard.""148   * Current Federal Law: 10 U.S.C.

"(75, 6)",-0.714285714,"Not sure what you mean. Natural selection is one of several mechanisms of evolution. Evolution is a change in the genetic makeup of a population of organisms over generations. Natural selection tends to decrease genetic diversity - thus changing the relative frequencies of genetic characteristics. There are othere mechanisms that also tend to decrease genetic diversity, and, of course, there are mechanisms that tend to increase it.","I think that Believer may be referring to microbe to man evolution (i.e. simple life to more complex life). Your definition is not entirely accurate and misleading. By this, massive ammounts of new information must be added to the genome of the microbe to get it to ""evolve"" to a human, about 999 books each consisting of 500 pages fine print of information must be added to change a microbe to a human. That's a lot of information isn't it? Now where does all that information come from? It can't come from a Creator, there's no Creator according to atheistic evolutionism. Evolutionists say that this new information comes from accidental changes in the DNA when the information is being copied, these acidents are called mutations.   Is this true though? Do mutations produce the new information required by microbe to man evolution? Dr Lee Spetner, an Israeli biophysicist says that there is not one mutation that one can point to that on the molecular level can be seen to increase the information in the genome. They actually all turn out to reduce the information in the genome. Let's take the example of the Totally Naked Rooster, the TNR mutant. What has the mutation done? It has obviously destroyed the information for making feathers. Has the rooster ever been improved by the mutation? From the point of view of the chook farmer, probably yes, because no feathers - no plucking required. But what about from the point of view of the rooster? Well, he's going to freeze in winter and fry in summer, not much of an improvement for the rooster. This mutation has destroyed the information for making feathers. It can also be shown that anti-biotic resistance is the result of an information losing mutation, and many other evidences of evolution in action are also the result of information losing mutations - which matches perfectly with the creationary model, i.e. varriation within a kind. See, evolution can cope with the occassional down-hill mutation, but they really need a lot and a lot of up-hill, information gaining mutations if they are going to change a reptile into a bird, for example, and change a microbe into a human over eons of years. The problem is, we just don't see these information gaining mutations occuring at all today.  Now natural selection is also supposed to be the hero of the plot to, right? Well, actually, natural selection also results in a loss of information for a certain population. We'll take the example of a population of dogs that are taken to a very cold environment with varrying fur (or hair) sizes. The population consists of the following fur sizes: LL - Long fur. Ll - Medium fur sizes. ll - Short fur sizes.  where L = long fur gene, and l = short fur gene.  Obviously, the cold will kill of those dogs that are not fit to handle the cold whether. The poor dogs with short fur sizes would be the first to go, then followed by the medium fur sized dogs - that makes sense doesn't it? Take them to a place like Antartica. Over short time, only the dogs with long fur sizes would survive. Our surviving population consists of the following fur sizes: LL - Long fur.  We started off with a or variety of fur sizes in the population, but, as you can see, the short haired gene was eliminated from the environment by natural selection. Thus the population has lost information. So natural selection does not add information to the population, it erases information that disadvantages a population from living in a certain environment, such as the short haired gene (l) in this case.  Hence, neither mutations nor natural selection adds any new information to the genome."

Natural what? I suppose people with cochlear implants are new species too because they've learnt to hear.  Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given... ""Finally, Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift. New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [e.g. K. Kato, et al., ?A plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation: Nucleotide sequence analysis of pOAD2?, Microbiology (Reading) 141(10):2585?2590, 1995.] In fact, more than one species of bacteria have the ability, residing on plasmids. This suggests that the information probably already existed, and was just passed between different types of bacteria.""  ""All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic (protein-degrading) enzyme. This may seem surprising? How would a loss of information create a new ability? Answer: enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule (the substrate). Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function, but would enable it to degrade other substrates, too. Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages, a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon. If this process were continued, the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required. To put it into perspective, acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions, but they also lack specificity. Indeed, an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme"" http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/feedback/negative7-24-2000.asp  Talkorigins gave their usual doubletalk ""Whilst this particular case does not ""prove"" evolution, it is consistent with, and supportive of, the theory of biological evolution.""

But it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations. One site does say that it, the bacteria, had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ?mutations?, but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus. http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htm  One poster on another forum summed the problem up like this... "" In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon eating bacteria. The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon, therefore was able to survive in a new environment. Two distinct advantages But, the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment, eat its former diet and suffered a 98% loss in efficiency. Three disadvantages. So by taking two steps forward and three steps backward, where is the net gain?

Sexual promiscuity does lead to pregnancy, an increased rate of sex will increase the rate of pregnancies, even when birth control is a factor. I do recognize that there are other problems involved with unplanned pregnancies and issues should be dealt with, though apparently the responsibility of creating solutions to these issues is given primarily to pro-life supporters. There are two main issues that have to be dealt with; reducing the amount of un-planned pregnancies, and giving more options to people who have an un-planned pregnancy. Now this may differ country to country depending on the social services that are available to support an unplanned pregnancy.

"(561, 6)",-1,"You are so right-on in what you say! In a Sunday school at a church I formerly attended, an elder of the church remarked that his ""faith was strengthened"" by the ""evidence"" afforded by recent archaeological discoveries in the middle east. In a tone I now rather regret, I blurted out two things... ...How weak was your faith before? and ...If the ""evidence"" had gone 'the other way,' would your faith then have been weakened? His answer for the second question was a simple 'no,' which suggests to me that the sense of the term 'evidence' he was employing was not the same sense you'd expect a scientist to use. His response to the first was problematic, and interesting. ""My faith,"" he said, has always been--then he used the most interesting word--""complete."" But he had taken sufficient offence already, it seemed, that I pressed no further. I wish sometimes that I'd asked: If your faith was ""always complete,"" did the archaeological evidence make it ""more complete""? And, if so, does your sense of 'complete' match that word's usual application?  I do not quite grasp the notion of there being ""scientific evidence"" for a proposition within the realm of faith. I do not mean to suggest that my claim that scientific and religious propositions reside in different discourses disposes of all worry or complaint. Activity in one realm may be felt in the other.  But, re: evolution, I think this...Given convincing evidence that, say, the earth is billions of years old, not thousands--a mound of evidence more than high enough for my needs--my worry is not that the 'Biblical account' of creation is wrong, erroneous, falsified...but rather is the quite different worry of wondering what, now, that account's meaning is, what it affirms. Scientific discovery, evidence, and discourse thus don't ""disprove the Bible."" Rather, they serve to displace interpretations of biblical text, and give us cause--I call it: opportunity--to find new, richer meaning in scripture.   I'm often embarrassed by the smallness and brittleness of certain Christians' interpretations. Emphasizing the 'literal,' as some do--a very problematic term in itself--some Christians see in, for example, the Genesis ""tree of the knowledge of good and evil"" nothing more than a tree. A biological tree. Pear tree. Peach tree. Apple tree. Tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Albeit a special species, nonetheless a species. And, for them, there you go--Eve chowed down on the fruit of a proscribed species, and that's your story. Lost, in the insistence upon and closing of that interpretation, is the richness of metaphor the story offers. Metaphor, again and again, is variously deliberately denigrated or unconsciously eclipsed, in the readings of certain Christians.  Science is not the only victim of such cheesily 'literal' interpretation. Christian faith--at least, the possibility of a rich faith robustly aware of its own weight in metaphor, parable, legend and myth, and the transformative power that arises from those aspects of scripture--is equally victim. I feel more sadness about such a limited believer's faith than I do about that person's science.  Master_Shake, for your poignantly apt remark--""what they have isn't faith at all""--thanks. Bless you!  Brad.","You can have reasoned faith, but it need not rely on 'empirical' evidence. There are very many forms of evidence."

For example an animal might have developed a wing like appendage, but it wouldn't have the correct muscles that it would need to actually move the wings.","I suspect that you are thinking of birds. But early birds had fingered claws on those wings. It is generally true that no organ ever springs into existance completely developed where nothing existed before. The wings of bats, birds, and pterodactyls are merely the modified fore-limb of a tetrapod. There is evidence that insect wings may have arisen from some sort of thermal panel. And of course, size has considerable relevance to flight. Wingless spiders fly by spinning a loop of silk that is carried by the moving air. Very small insects require almost no wings to fly. What they do is more similar to a whale in water than a bird in air. If by chance, a small animal is upsized because of a competetive advantage, and the wings are too, then it becomes a larger flying animal."

Anyway, its possible that not a lot of speciation took place in that time, plus its arguable that there wasnt a lot of migration away from the Eden area either. so all the animals in the Earth were relatively close-by, and there couldnt have been a great number of new or variant species from the ones originally created.

I know it's a bit unusual in a public forum but I'd like to introduce a little personal history here by way of illustration of my path to atheism: I was educated during my most impressionable years (11-18) at a grammar school controlled by the Jesuits. All my teachers were priests and many were of formidable intellect. Every morning began with ""divine service"", every lesson was started and ended with a prayer. At noon we sang the Angelus and at 3.30 in the afternoon we finished the school day with Benediction. We had at least one session a day learning and reciting the catechism - so we could be word perfect in our answers to metaphysical questions. Yet all this religious conditioning failed to arouse any spark of faith in me. Sure, I conformed to all outward appearances, but inwardly I rebelled and I did not believe. So why didn't I believe - because my clergymen teachers gave me no REASONS to do so. When, eventually, during my last days at school I chose to reveal my disbelief - the Rector said, ""Well, after all, faith is a gift from God !"" , and I had received no such gift.  Since, in my view, there is no reasoned evidence for God's existence, why succumb to wish-fulfillment ? It's less comforting but more honest to be an atheist.","I'm an atheist pretty much the same reason you are an atheist (except for going to a religious school.  I didn't really think it was fair and balanced at all. It protrayed atheists as lost from the true path. The reasons it gave for being atheist were they hadn't found god yet, and a tradgedy. What about logically thinking about it? And a RELIGIOUS STUDIES teacher says that atheism is just a phase? They also say atheism is the easy way out. I think it's easier to just believe in a god and be comforted. I'm not saying people do but I'd say Christianity is more of a quick fix than atheism. All you have to do is believe in god and you're safe for your life and afterwards. Most Atheists don't believe what they do just to rebel or haven't found God yet. Mostly it's because they realized that there is no logical proof (enough for them) that there is God.

Life advances and evolves according to natural selection, and the law that the strong survive and the weak are eaten, or else-wise deleted through some manifestation of their weakness. social answer: not applicable. humans are the only ""creatures"" who can belong to society, and therefore, obviously, only humans have the ""right"" to life. religious answer: any creature with a soul has the ""right"" to live.  conclusion: the issue as it relates to this question is inherently a religious issue, because scientifically the question is null, and socially it has no meaning.  question b) when do these creatures get the right to live? scientific answer: never. same reason as above. social answer: any creature who ""becomes"" human acquires the right to live. religious answer: any creature who acquires a soul acquires the right to live.  conclusion: this time the issue is not only religious; there is a combination of societal issues and religious issues which contribute to answering this question. no conclusion can really be made, yet, though the social answer leads to the obvious question: can a creature ""become"" human? does a maturing fetus in the womb ""become"" human at some point? or is it human from the moment of inception? i argue for the former, though plenty of people will disagree.   question c) why do these creatures have the right to live at the time I give for question c: see my answers above. they are detailed.    there is a very, very, very very VERY major question which you completely glossed over, and which is very very VERY pertinent to the issue. i raised this question to a short extent in the conclusion for question b.  i'll call it ""question d)""  question d: at what point does a creature become human?  obviously, this question is debatable. my personal opinion is that a creature (a fetus) becomes human at such time as it could live with minimal medical assistance outside of the mother's womb. this contributes to my further opinion that the larger issue is predominantly a religious one, because with the answer to this question i remove the only reason which would oppose me to abortion prior to the time of capability of self-sustainment.  on the other hand, there are others who are not religious, who are against abortion. always, these are the people who answer this last question differently than me. always, these are the people who believe that from the time of conception, a fetus is in fact a human being.  i cannot argue with their reasoning; it makes every bit as much sense as mine. from a purely physical standpoint, it makes even more sense. yet i stand by my point of view.  i submit, though, that if you want to exclude religion from the discussion, this is the only truly debatable point about abortion whatsoever.  anything else is religion. and that's a whole other can of worms."

There is a question raised about all those kinds of beasts which are not domesticated, nor are produced like frogs from the earth, but are propagated by male and female parents, such as wolves and animals of that kind; and it is asked how they could be found in the islands after the deluge, in which all the animals not in the ark perished, unless the breed was restored from those which were preserved in pairs in the ark. It might, indeed, be said that they crossed to the islands by swimming, but this could only be true of those very near the mainland; whereas there are some so distant, that we fancy no animal could swim to them. But if men caught them and took them across with themselves, and thus propagated these breeds in their new abodes, this would not imply an incredible fondness for the chase. At the same time, it cannot be denied that by the intervention of angels they might be transferred by God's order or permission. If, however, they were produced out of the earth as at their first creation, when God said, ""Let the earth bring forth the living creature,""25 this makes it more evident that all kinds of animals were preserved in the ark, not so much for the sake of renewing the stock, as of prefiguring the various nations which were to be saved in the church; this, I say, is more evident, if the earth brought forth many animals in islands to which they could not cross over.

First, God commanded Noah to take two of every living creature without distinguishing between clean or not clean ones: Gen 6: 19-20 ""And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive."" Then, God distinguished between the clean creatures and the unclean as follow: Gen 7: 2-3 ""Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female. Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth."" Noah though, took only two of every kind ignoring the second command of God by taking seven of the clean ones as it is stated here: Gen 7: 8-9 ""Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.""  A Noah did not ignore God's commandment but followed it exactly. God's command to Noah was ""Two of every sort ?. , to keep them alive"" (Gen 6:19-20) Those are the minimum of each species to go in the ark and be kept alive afterwards. Then God gave Noah more specific instructions, to take seven pairs of the clean beasts and of the clean birds. The purpose of this became clear after the flood. The birds were needed to explore the earth (Gen 8:7-12) and the clean animals to be used as sacrifice to the Lord. Noah did not ignore this commandment but the Bible says "" There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female""  If you read this carefully it does not say one pair of each species but that they went in as pairs males and females. If Noah had taken only one pair of each and then offered each of these pairs in sacrifice, these species would have become completely extinct."

You may have to put up with it, as there may be some people who choose to do that, and you have no control to stop them. Just as a suggestion, you may get further by asking respectfully that people not comment unless they have read the entire article. My two cents.)  In this particular article, Mr. Alcorn does not back up any of his assertions with evidence. Some of what he states in this article is common knowledge that needs no documentation (i.e. a human fetus is human and it is alive). But in this article, he states many generalities, he states many opinions (to which there are alternate views), and he backs nothing up. I'm not saying that the facts he presents cannot be backed up, but until they are backed up with solid documentation, there are a lot of holes in what he is saying.  For example: ""2f. There is substantial scientific reason to believe frozen embryos are persons, and should be granted the same rights as older, larger and less vulnerable persons."" Substantial scientific reason??? Like what? A 'person' is not a scientific concept. Science does not identify the definitions of what can or cannot be labeled a 'person.' That is a legal and/or philisophical topic.  ""3g. Even before the unborn is obviously human in appearance, she is what she is-a human being."" Here again, a human being is not a scientific term.   ""3e. Every abortion stops a beating heart and terminates measurable brain waves.""  This is not necessarily true. Mr. Alcorn also asserts that the birth control pill causes abortions prior to implantation of the blastocyst in the uterine lining. There is no beating heart or measurable brain activity at this stage of biological development. Both of his assertions, as stated, cannot be correct. If one statement is true, then the other must logically be false.  ""5d. It is a scientific fact that there are thought processes at work in unborn babies. ""  Where's the evidence? Define 'thought processes.' It may be a fact... that leaves open the possibility that it may not be true.  ""5h.

Once we grant that the unborn are human beings, it should settle the question of their right to live. ""  True. But we have not yet granted that unborn are 'human beings.'  ""13b. The poor choice of premarital sex is never compensated for by the far worse choice of killing an innocent human being.""  Again. This is merely Mr. Alcorn's opinion -- both that premarital sex is a 'poor choice' and the remainder of the statement.  ""14a. Early feminists were prolife, not prochoice. ""  Define 'early.' Are we talking back to the days of Eve? I don't believe Margaret Sanger was prolife.  ""14d. The basic premises of the abortion-rights movement are demeaning to women. ""  Unsupported opinion.  ""17a. Every child is wanted by someone-there is no such thing as an unwanted child. ""  How many children are on the street in this great country? How many children are waiting to be adopted? It may be true that all children are wanted by someone, but it is also true that there are many, many children without a home and without a family... who are being bounced around from foster home to foster home, not finding anyone who 'wants' them. This is fact. A dear friend of mine is a child protection social worker in a metropolitan area. She deals with this every day.  ""18c.

We can only make educated guesses.  I could go on... but I think my point has been made. One final one, though... I had to giggle when I read this one: ""Abortion has made us a nation of schizophrenics about our children.""  It seems that you are fervent in your beliefs that abortion is 'wrong.' I respect you for knowing what you believe and for standing up for it. Understand, though, that there are individuals who may disagree with you. To imply that they are 'wrong' and you are 'right' or they are ignorant or stupid or anything of the sort is a rather self-centered view of the world. In this mindset, it is possible that you are looking at everything from the 'wrong' perspective. Maybe the other person is actually 'right' and you are the ignorant one. (Note: I'm not suggesting that you are calling anyone stupid or ignorant... nor am I suggesting you are stupid or ignorant. I'm just making a point.)  I challenge you to develop a logical argument -- based on facts with supporting evidence, and not based on opinions or 'moral ideals' -- that is so convincing that even the most 'pro-choice' person in the world could see (if they are being honest with themselves and the world) that abortion is 'wrong.'."

Of course, this is based on the belief that the Bible is true. Many other great scientists, including Newton and Galileo also seemed to believe that science and Christianity were compatible.   Reason stems from the belief that the universe is orderly, rational and logical. By the dictionary, reason is the intellectual faculty by which conclusions are drawn from premises. Now, if we are accidents of pure chance (which evolution teaches) than the thought patters that determine your logic are also products of chance. If your logic is the result of chance processes, you can't even be sure it evolved properly.

When a woman who's OD'ed is brought to a hospital, they take steps to save her... they don't just say ""She's a druggie, she's obviously sick of life, we'll respect her right to die"". Even if she recovers, and lucidly announces the same intent, they will take steps to stop her. It is because it is un-natural. It is un-natural to kill another human or to harm another human. People do it, but we don't just accept it... we try and put these people into a place where they're not going to do it again.  Further, if a woman smokes, her 'right to smoke' might impinge upon my right to be in a smoke free environment. Why is it that restaurants (at least in this country) now have to be smoke free? Why is my right greater than hers?  I might point out that the woman in question has every right to go down and file a DNR and a living will, and then the medical responders would be required by law to adhere to it. If she went and OD'ed again, and was going to die, they would have to let her die... in effect she has gone through all neccessary legal steps to end her life. When a woman goes into a clinic to have an abortion, she also complies with the law, but for some reason, there will always be someone who doesn't think she should be allowed the right to do so.  Restaurants are not required to be smoke free. There are some local ordinances that may require it, but it is not a federal law. Workplaces, yes, restaurants, no. Walk into any diner in say, Cheyenne, WY to see it I'm wrong. The reasons a restauranteur might decide to make his establishment non-smoking are numerous. The fact is, in most venues, the smoker is the minority, and so it only makes sense. My own opinion is that, while a smoker can last an hour or so for dinner without dying for a smoke, some vehement non-smokers could not last two minutes if they were within a half mile of a lit cigarette. (you know the type, the suburban soccer mom who coughs on sight of a cigarette, the one who will traipse through a discount motel at midnight looking at 10 rooms because none of them ""smell right"").","You are arguing from US law, I am arguing from Australian law.

It rewards home owners with deductions for mortgage interest. I don't see rewarding hetero marriage as being any different. The government is promoting hetero marriage.","Well, I do understand that you call it a benefit for compliance, but my argument was that a benefit for compliance is the same thing as a fine for non-compliance and that in reality, the government is simply promoting one lifestyle over another. That is equivalent to destroying freedom. I do understand that the government rewards people for taking certain actions. IRA's are an example, yes, promoting investment in an IRA does destroy freedom in a sense. But there is at least a debatable reason behind the government using taxpayer money to reward IRA investers. The government wants people to have money in their old age so that they will be happier in the long run. But when the government is promoting heterosexual marriage, it isn't because promoting heterosexual marriage over homosexual marriage is a good thing, and it isn't because heterosexual couples deserve more money or more benefits than same-sex couples. It is because the majority is willing to use religious beliefs as a reason to give themselves more benefits under the law, as a reason to hurt others while benefiting themselves, as a reason to promote their own religoius beliefs over someone else's."

And if they had produced the corpse, then it is almost certain that Christianity would have been destroyed (for the early Christians believed in nothing less than the literal bodily resurrection). Given that the faith was not destroyed, it is implausible that His body was still in the tomb. Of course, there is a whole lot more to consider than this.  Furthermore, a miraclous event (such as Jesus' resurrection) is improbable on the assumption that the miracle did not occur - but is to be expected on the assumption that it did. That is, if there was no resurrection, the emergence of Christianity is highly improbable; but if there was a resurrection, the emergence of Christianity is very likely. This is in the form ""if A happened, then it is most likely that B"".","yes, on the grounds of ""mostly likely"" we can make reasonable assumptions. but we must still treat them as such.  part of the catch of God's existence is that no evidence of his existence cn ever be found. if Jesus actually physically performed observable miracles, even 2000 years ago, then it would surely proven that the supernatural can and does (or did) exist in reality. however, even jesus's ministry contradicts the faith theory. how can God expect faith from those who haven't observed on the grounds of those who have? if people can observe the manifested power of God in reality, then they have physical evidence that God exists. but this conflicts with the nature of God from a biblical standpoint. in other words, the bible cannot claim that physical evidence for the existence of God can exist, and then that it cannot exist, without contradicting itself. what we end up with is the predicament that ANY physical evidence that could possibly support God's existence is evidence against God's existence (at least from a biblical standpoint)."

A sudden collision of the continents at the end of the flood would produce very different geologic features.  That is the difference between accepted geologic theories and creationist theories.

Using patterns in executions across the study period and the relatively steady rate of murders in Texas, the authors found no evidence of a deterrent effect. The study concluded that the number of executions was unrelated to murder rates in general, and that the number of executions was unrelated to felony rates.

Bailey examined the period between 1989 and 1991 for total killings and sub-types of killing. After controlling for a number of variables, Bailey found that there was no evidence for a deterrent effect.

The UVVA would give separate legal status to a fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus even if the woman does not know she is pregnant.  ""The so-called Unborn Victims of Violence Act (UVVA) is not intended to protect pregnant women from domestic violence or punish individuals who harm them,"" said PPFA President Gloria Feldt. ""It is part of a deceptive anti-choice strategy to make women's bodies mere vessels by creating legal personhood for the fetus.""  The UVVA was created with the sole aim of undermining the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision, in which the Supreme Court ruled that ""the word 'person' as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the unborn."" This bill elevates the legal status of a fetus to make it equal to that of the adult woman who actually suffers the primary injury. It is part of ongoing attempts to bestow personhood on the fetus by granting it separate legal rights equal to and independent of those of the pregnant woman.  This legislation, which passed the Senate 61 to 38, fails to mention the harm to the woman resulting from an involuntary termination of her pregnancy. Sponsors of the UVVA today made their ideological goal abundantly clear: when given the opportunity to vote for a substitute bill that had virtually identical criminal penalties but recognized the pregnant woman, rather than the fetus, as the victim, they voted against the alternative.  ""Violence against women, including pregnant women, is a significant problem in America, one that should be addressed,"" stated Feldt. ""This bill does nothing but shift the focus away from real solutions by undermining women's health and reproductive freedoms.""  Because the UVVA is a Federal Bill, it cannot actually be used in any murder case, which would fall under State Law. This would make the UVVA ineffectual in actually protecting a pregnant woman, but create a stepping stone for a national ban on abortion. An alternate version of the bill, which recognizes the pregnant woman as the victim, and includes a provision to the Tenth Amendment (States Rights), was voted against by the same people who voted for the UVVA.","That is fairly rediculous. The bill is being used as a political tool and will not help women at all.

The zygote/blastocyst/embryo/fetus/neonate/baby/child (whichever label you choose) is a member of the species homo sapiens sapiens.

"(1056, 3)",-1.6,"To answer your question, yes I would support abstinence to protect anyone's health, not just women's. Risks of STIs including AIDS and unwanted pregnancy are obvious examples that can be largely avoided by not having sex.  Cervical cancer is triggered by a virus that a woman is exposed to through sex. Even if she does not contract any STD, there is a high correlation between rates of cervical cancer, HPV(human papolloma virus), and having intercource. Cervical cancer almost never occurs in virgins, and there is a high rate of occurrence in women who have had multiple sex partners.  Abstinent women also have lower rates of urinary tract infections and vaginitis. Those can be caused by skin being dragged into the vagina inadvertently during intercourse, and the penis has bacteria on it just like all skin.  Teenage girls also would obviously have higher levels of academic achievement if they are abstinent. Less depression and emotional turmoil due to relationship problems if they are abstinent, as well as less domestic or partner abuse.  However, I don't believe that advocating abstinence only is a smart way of approaching a problem. Obviously very few people are abstinent all of their lives; intercourse is a normal part of a healthy lifestyle. Preaching abstinence-until-marriage is also an unreachable goal and means nothing to same-sex couples. Furthermore, there is little scientific evidence that shows that abstinence only education works. Research demonstrates that comprehensive sex education, including abstinence and contraception, is the most effective, according to well-respected groups including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Society for Adolescent Medicine, the Institute of Medicine, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association. All of these groups reject abstinence only programs in favor of comprehensive sex education.  The Institute of Medicine recommends ""Congress, as well as other federal, state and local policymakers, eliminate the requirements that public funds be used for abstinence-only education and that states and local school districts implement and continue to support age-appropriate comprehensive sex education.""

"(297, 5)",-1.5,"Miracles, such as Jesus' resurrection, can provide evidence for a religious belief, which hence, provides evidence for God's existence, following directly from a principle which J. L. Mackie has defended, and requires no assumptions about violations of natural laws. The principle states that a piece of evidence raises the likelihood of a hypothesis whenever that evidence is more likely given the hypothesis. The principle follows from the axioms of probability and is central to common sense reasoning. Footprints in the dirt confirm that someone has been walking there since the footprints are more likely to be there given that someone did walk there. The sound of the siren suggests that there is a fire nearby, for a siren is more likely to be heard when there is a fire nearby.  Antony Flew and Mackie both agree that while miracles are extremely improbable, their occurrence is more likely on the assumption that God exists. More specific religious beliefs may rise further the likelihood of a miracle. So it follows from Mackie's criterion of confirmation that the occurrence of miralces may confirm religious hypotheses. For instance, since the resurrection of Jesus is far more likely on the assumption that He was divine, the resurrection, if we knew it to have occurred, would confirm Jesus' divinity and thus the truth of the Bible and it's revelation about God and His existence. Of course, it does not prove it, but it does provide substantial support.","again, this is only good as a reasonable assumption, and nothing more. in many cases, the least likely answer is true. you cannot create evidence out of assumptions. you test the assumptions against reality, then the assumptions can be confirmed. i agree that reasonable assumptions are useful, but basing an assumption upon another assumption causes the likeliness to decrease.  for example, under the assumption that (a) jesus is devine, and that (b) God exists, it is likely that (c) jesus performed miracles. c can only be considered a reasonable assumption of a and b were already true. since a and b are assumptions themselves, then it makes c much more unlikely.  as opposed to the case of the footprints. if (a) people wear shoes and (b) there is a footprint in the lawn, it is likely that (c) a person stood on the lawn. in this case, a and b are verifiable, and by they being true, we can consider c a reasonable assumption."

"(432, 3)",-2,"Thank you Lurch. You have gotten to my point: Evolution (as taught in modern public school textbooks) is a religion, not a scientific fact (as claimed by sarablaze).","So what you are saying is that even though you claimed to have studied evolution, you have not. I understand.  In fact, my religion is not evolution. I even hold my religion in higher regard than to consider using it as an insult. Since you think that calling science a religion is an insult, your religion must be trivial and largely meaningless.  But that aside, since you want to lump all of science into the word ""evolution"" so that you can reject it all at once, I'm just going to use the word science. sarablaze isn't a scientist and, like you, has probably had very little scientific education. But I'm going to try to explain to you again.  A religion is held by faith. That means that it is not supported by actual evidence. On the other hand, science is not accepted by faith since it is built on a process of questioning and testing everything. There is nothing in science that I ""believe"". Do I believe that the earth orbits the sun? No. But when presented with the observations of the relative positions of the sun and planets, the most parsimonious explanation is that it is so. I accept that and will accept that until someone can present more evidence and a better explanation. That is true of all science. I don't believe any of it but accept the explanations that have been tested that account for the observations.  In science, by the way, the facts are the observations - not the theories. So the facts of gravity are the observations of things falling to earth and observations of the relative positions of the planets. The current theory of gravity only imperfectly explains those facts - it is part of the general theory of relativity developed by Einstein.  In biology, the facts are that we observe living things to change over time. We even have facts from many different fields (biogeography, genetics, molecular biology, population genetics, morphology, embryology, paleontology, and others) that point to the fact that living things change over time. The explanations of the mechanics of those changes form the theory of evolution."

I had a small debate about this with the bootfitter in another section on abortion. I don't think that Sandycane was not pointing out that you have no morals, they just aren't absolute, i.e. you get to choose them for yourself.   You may indeed have exactly the same morals and values that I have, but you still have ""relative morality"" as you have choosen those yourself.

""Since today's 'well regulated militia' does not use privately owned firearms, courts since Miller have unanimously held that regulation of such guns does not offend the Second Amendment...As lawyers, as representatives of the legal profession, and as recognized experts on the meaning of the Constitution and our system of justice, we share a responsibility to the public and lawmakers to 'say what the law is.'"" http://www.abanet.org/gunviol/secondamend.html  4) Historians H. Richard Uviller and William G. Merkel explain the language of the second amendment this way- ""It does not say: 'a well-regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state, and the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed'....it wasn't written that way. Rather, in the first part, the verbal vehicle elected for the verb 'to be' is a participle, yielding a phrase known to grammarians as an 'ablative absolute construction.' This construction characterizes a phrase modifying the substance of the main clause as an adjective would modify a noun, often expressing the condition or circumstances of the assertion of the main clause. It creates an indissoluble link between the two parts of the sentence, and grammatically subjects the right to arms to the rule of the militia modifier. As a simple matter of grammar, the participial modifier is essential for the declarative clause to occur. Had the two statements- regarding the importance of a militia and the right to arms- not been joined in this manner, it might have been possible to argue that even if the first declaration ceases to be true, the second is undiminished. And it seems significant that the Framers chose the structure they did."".","SO we are sticking with the now defamed ""collective right theory"" As of yet you have not explained:  How the people in the 2nd amendment differ from the people in the other amendments.  why the government would put a bill of rights that pertained to ""the people"" in all the other amendments but somehow saw the need to write one for themselves in the 2nd.

Riding a dead horse indeed!    http://opinionjournal.com/columnist...l/?id=110004653  Bellesiles Misfires  An antigun ""scholar"" as today's Galileo? Oh please, just shoot me.   BY KIMBERLEY A. STRASSEL  Friday, February 6, 2004 12:01 a.m. EST   History has its fair share of persecuted geniuses, men who were ahead of their time and made to pay for it. There's the hemlocked Socrates, the house-arrested Galileo, the exiled Rousseau. And to this list of giants it seems that we are now expected to add the name of Michael Bellesiles.  Mr. Bellesiles is the former Emory professor who shook the scholarly world in 2000 with his book ""Arming America."" An academic bombshell, the tome went against long-held beliefs by claiming that few colonial Americans actually owned guns. This set off a riotous public debate over whether the Second Amendment was designed to protect individual gun rights. Mr. Bellesiles was showered with prizes and media praise, becoming an instant academic star.  That is, until his peers started looking into that little thing called research. Reputable scholars in the ensuing months tore apart his work on probate and military records, travel narratives, and other documents. Mr. Bellesiles, when asked to explain, provided ever-more outlandish excuses: that his notes had been lost in a flood, that his Web site had been hacked, that he couldn't remember where he'd found certain documents. The officials of the prestigious Bancroft Prize stripped him of his award, he left Emory and Knopf chose to stop publishing his book. Most of us sighed happily and figured that was the end of that academic scandal.  But oh, no. It turns out that Mr. Bellesiles is still riding his dead horse, his nonexistent guns still blazing. Soft Skull Press (which takes pride in putting out books that other publishers avoid like ricin) has not only agreed to reissue ""Arming America"" but has decided to release Mr. Bellesiles's latest response to his critics. This 59-page pamphlet, ""Weighed in an Even Balance,"" is a spirited attempt by Mr. Bellesiles to turn himself into the world's latest misunderstood genius. As such, it's worth reading for pure entertainment value.      Much of the booklet is a repeat of the professor's creative excuses and dissembling. He explains again about the flood and helpfully assures us that he is not an agent of the Zionist Occupational Government (though surely that is why the Bancroft panel took away his prize, right?). He does acknowledge a few errors, but only after pointing out that ""even the finest scholars . . . make mistakes."" As proof, he cites one blooper in esteemed historian David McCullough's 1,120-page biography of Harry Truman. But the most amusing parts of the pamphlet are those meant to support our scholar's belief that he is up against a stubborn world that refuses to open its mind to the truth. And his sense of persecution and righteousness is very much on display. The very title of his book is taken from Job: ""Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may known mine integrity.""  And that's just for starters. The pamphlet is sprinkled with quotations from thoughtful men, all meant to back up Mr. Bellesiles's argument that he is fighting the good fight. We hear from Isaiah Berlin: ""Few things have done more harm than the belief on the part of individuals or groups . . . that he or she or they are in sole possession of the truth."" One epigraph recounts that in the 16th century, Oxford used to fine any student who diverged from the teachings of Aristotle. We are clearly meant to envision a feisty Mr. Bellesiles handing over his shillings to the dons.  We are treated to lecturing tracts about the benefits of scholarly disagreement, the complex nature of historical research and the need for academic exploration. And finally, in case readers still aren't getting his drift, Mr. Bellesiles sums it all up in his conclusion: ""There are those who rest their very identity on the notion of a certain, unchanging past. The vision that society is unalterable is not just incorrect, it is dangerously undemocratic, and as such should be of concern to every modern historian.""      In fact, the academic world is hardly a monolothic creature that resists all change. If it were, we'd still be trying to explain how the sun moves around the Earth. Most historians and scientists are wise enough to realize that new discoveries or interpretations hold out opportunity. But before they completely cast aside mountains of research, they usually demand some proof. Mr. Bellesiles's problem isn't that he's misunderstood; it's that he still hasn't given them any. Or as the old saying goes: ""To be a persecuted genius, you not only have to be persecuted; you also have to be right.""   Ms. Strassel is a senior editorial page writer for The Wall Street Journal."

Only a tiny minority thought that it was actually one of the small, lightly built coelurosaurian dinosaurs [small lightly framed dinosaurs].","1984, huh? I'm sure that is all still very relevant. Actually there is a lot of discussion about the nature of Archaeopteryx. Much of it deals with whether it could fly and what it teaches us about how birds came to fly - ground up or trees down. But what they all agreed on, even back then, was that Archaeopteryx is a transitional. Taxonomic debates aren't really very meaningful, really. Creationists like to make a big deal about the fact that most taxonomists and ornithologists classify Archaeopteryx as a bird. But where else would it go? That's a limitation of the Linnean classification system - everything is put somewhere, even if it doesn't exactly fit. The only debate about the evolution of Archaeopteryx among experts is whether it evolved from theropod dinorsaurs or from archosaurs. It's still a transitional."

No. Do they have maternity wards? No. What do they do? They give out pregnancy tests and do abortions. That's where they get their money- a quarter of all their revenue is from pre 13-week abortions. This is not even countig their later more expensive abortons that are also so common! They get $40 million a year for abortions alone.","Again, I did not say that they did not recommend abortion... they do offer it as an option, but I have never heard of anyone being 'forced' to have one by Planned Parenthood. All I was disputing was when you said that they ALWAYS recommended it. They do offer pregnancy counseling, along with pregnancy testing. They also offer birth control, gynecological care, STD testing, infertility testing, sexual education counseling, prenatal care, adoption referrals.. etc...Almost all of these things are offered by my regular doctor, and probably most other doctors as well. They don't have a maternity ward at Planned Parenthood because they aren't a hospital, and you can go to your own hospital to have an ultrasound done, but if a clinic does an abortion themselves, they have to do an ultrasound first, to determine how far along the pregnancy is, because there are different procedures for different amounts of weeks. If an ob/gyn sees an ultrasound with severe problems, they will sometimes recommend an abortion too.  All in all, I just thought that your remark that Planned Parenthood always recommended an abortion was wrong. They also offer services to men too, do you think they recommend abortion to them as well?? I have nothing wrong with you being pro-life... I honestly don't. I think it's good that you stand up for what you believe in. But when you make a statement on how a woman is wrong to have an abortion even if her own life is in danger, I find that a little ignorant. I'm not saying that you are ignorant yourself, but I don't think you are as well informed on everything as you seem to think you are.  And can I ask, are you male? If you are, you will never, ever be in any type of situation like that, so how can you decide what a woman should do when SHE is faced with a situation?"

How can science explain through statistical probablity the over 600 prophecies in Biblical writings that have come to pass?

Job 26:7 He stretches out the north over empty space; He hangs the earth on nothing.    How did they know that the ""vapors"" of the earth rise to create moisture, that is seeded by lightning with nitrogen and then falls as rain to fertilze the soil?

Even though the Bible is not a scientific text book and doesn't purport to be, nowhere is it scientifically inaccurate. In addition, many of the scientific ideas you are so impressed with are nothing new to the Bible. It was speaking of these things long before modern science spoke of them.  The story goes ""They (scientists) are slowly working their way to the mountain's peak painstakingly measuring and analyzing every step that they take. After many years of research, they finally arrive at the top of the mountain, scale over its leading edge, only to find a group of theologians sitting there with the answers all along."".","Once one is adept at finding evidence after a conclusion is presumed, all sorts of ""proofs"" reveal themselves.

If this is incorrect, and you can prove it (this pertains primarily to Lurch) try not to get your panties in a twist, okay?  There are a couple problems here: -There are supposed ""inherited similaritys"" in the forelimbs of birds and theropods. Both have a three-fingered ""hand"", but embryological studies indicate that the ""hand"" of the bird consist of digits II-III-IV, but theropods have I-II-III. This is very contrary to the view that theropods evolved evolved into birds. (Burke A.C. and Feduccia A. Developmental patterns and the identification of homologies in the avian hand. Science, 24 October 1997, Volume 278, 666-668).  -A second problem is the structure of the lungs. When studied, Sinosauropteryx revealed that in theropods, the thoracic cavity is seperate from the abdominal cavity near the diaphram. Birds have no such separation. There is no clear way that this could change without debilitating effects to the bird. (Ruben J.A., Jones T.D., Geist N.R. and Hillenius W.J. Lung structure and ventilation in theropod dinosaurs and early birds. Science, 14 November 1997, Volume 278, 1267-1270).   -Finally, the hips are a trouble spot. While birds are ""bird hipped"" (duh) the theropod dinosaurs were ""lizard hipped"". If evolution is true, then birds should have evolved from the ornithischian dinosaurs, whom were bird hipped.","Did you get this from a website or did you actually go and browse the journals? I'm guessing the former as these objections have been specifically addressed before.  Do you really expect to learn anything by copying creationist argument after creationist argument from websites that usually requires an understanding, that has taken biologists years to learn, then simply say ""here, deal with this""? Yet when the errors are explained you simply move on to the next subject.  I asked myself some time ago, ""What would it take to convince myself that evolution is a good explanation for biodiversity"", then I set out a series of subjects I didn't understand, read as much creationist material as I could find, then juxtaposing it with as much evolutionary material as I could find and tried to see who was most convincing. Three years and half a biological science degree later I came to several conclusions.  1) Creationists have little understanding about the nature of science and evolution for many reasons.  2) Evolutionary Biologists have already thought of objections that take creationists years to come up with and debunked them several times over, or made appropriate changes to hypothesis with explanations that are several orders of magnitude more impressive than any creationist material.  3) Creationists will obstinately perpetuate falsehoods with inordinate banality, misquote out of context, demonise and vilify beyond logical explanation.  4) Evolutionary theory is predictive, falsifiable, consistent, parsimonious and well established amongst the scientific community; it is the best scientific explanation for biological diversity.

Early judicial opinion of the the Firearms act was based on the fact that the Thompson and sawed off shot gun was not a military serviceable weapon and does not apply to the 2nd Amendment. The Thompson and sawed off shotgun were not used by the US Army. Guess what? The Thompson was adpoted by the Army a few years later. So then, what does that mean?

It means it is on shakey Constitutional ground.  Some points I have for you:  1) Flash supressor? Argued by anti-gunners prevent shooters from hiding thier position.  Completely false. Flash hiders can hide flash from the target. It's main purpose is to hide flash from the SHOOTER! The flash startles the shooter and makes bullets ballistically unstable:  ""Excessive muzzle flash happens when unburned powder ignites at the muzzle, causing turbulence behind the bullet with a detrimental effect on accuracy."" - http://www.shootingsoftware.com/loadens.htm  Flash has more to do with the ammo than the attachment on the end. The Flash hidder ban has lowered target shooting scores more than protecting lives.  2) Magazine limit? Argued by anti-gunners to save lives. Argued to prevent rapid and large expendature of rounds down range upon victims. True, but how often do you hear that? When it does happen it is national news. The real threat is from guns that contain more 2 less than 4 bullets:  http://ip.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/2/151  The anti-gunners know this and are comming after your 6 shot revolvers next. They just wanted people to started getting used it to idea of banning bullet capacity.  So then. The ban on more than 10 bullets? It really does not do anything than give a false sense of security. If public policy productive and actally do something, then the ban on 10 bullets is a farce.  3) Bayonet? I can not even fathom a reason to ban them other than emotional reasons. Simly because they look dangerous I suppose is why they are banned. Will someone please let me know? Public policy should not be based on emotional reasons to be truely good and effective policy.  4) Pistol grip? They make controling an automatic weapon easier to sight on your target.

Further to that, many of their notions about science aren't scientific, but based on philosophies of science; such as their false belief that there's only one 'scientific method', or that materialism, itself, is the only method of evolutionary theory. And to top it all off, science can't actually determine what is true, anyway.  So they're arguing against a belief in certainty from a belief in uncertainty.

These witnesses for Christ were killed for their faith. How many Christians would we have today if they had to die for their faith? In spite of everything that the emperor did, they could not kill the Christians fast enough.

No. Let's compare this to a drivers license. Yes I realize that's not a product, but it is regulated similar to the way guns should be regulated. It varies from state to state, but there is typically a driver's ed class, driving with an instructor, and a driving test. A person must pass all of these things before recieving a license. A person must also meet other qualifications such as vision requirements. Then, in my state, when a person recieves his or her license, it is only a provisional license, meaning that he or she cannot drive between midnight and 5 a.m. This lasts for eighteen months unless there are any moving violations, in which case the period starts over.

Even GunCite, a pro gun website, says, "" 'To put in good order' is the correct interpretation of well regulated, signifying a well disciplined, trained, and functioning militia."" Disciplining, training. That sounds like controlling. And if it was such a simple constitutional issue, why hasn't the Supreme Court made a difinitive ruling on it?

Cthulhu's scenario may be an unrealistic one but would force someone who is pro-life to consider the relative worth of the baby vs zygote.

Given that introduction, if you or other pro-life people were faced with that awful choice, would you: 1) Consider both so exactly equally worthy that you would indeed be frozen in indecision, or possibly decide based on chance (a flip of a coin) 2) Choose one over the other based on moral considerations  Note: I believe it would be obvious to almost everyone that your choosing one over the other does not mean that you condone the killing of that other.

The wingless beetles of which you speak actually have wings. You seem to speak from ignorance of science while you accuse others of speaking of ignorance of creationism. Let me explain. When disected, the beetles of which you speak have fully formed wings under the fused wing covers (which are themselves modified wings in beetles). It seems that time, in an evolutionary sense, has not been sufficent to make your ""wingless"" beetles wingless. Since the wing covers are fused, the underlying wings are useless. In another environment that would not be an advantage.This makes perfect sense in an evolutionary scenario. Wingless (or fused wing cover) beetles in my back yard get snapped up by the anole and the geckos. But the winds in my yard are rarely more than can be handled by any insect (only once in over 20 years - huricane Alicia). And when that is the case, they go to ground and hang on.  By the way, mutations don't happen by natural selection. The very statement is utter nonsese. You are demonstrating your ignorance of biological science. Mutations (of various types) are changes in the genetic makeup of an individual. If those changes are in gonads that produce gametes, then they may be passed on to offspring. Mutations are one source of genetic variability in a population. It is that variability that is acted upon by other evolutionary mechanisms to change a population over time.  Both mutation and natural selection are mechanisms of evolution. Mutation increases genetic variability, while natural selection tends to reduce it. There are other mechanisms (sexual selection (-), gene flow (+), recombination (+), genetic drift (-)). The very statement, ""mutation by natural selection"" shows ignorance of the subject. Please try to inform yourself of the topic before you speak in the future.

The prominent British evolutionist, Richard Dawkins, comments, ""... [W]e find many of them already in an advanced state of evolution, the very first time they appear. It is as though they were just planted there, without any evolutionary history.""51  Two places in the world that have an abundance of early (Cambrian) fossils; the Burgess Shale in the Canadian Rockies and the Chengjiang site in China.38  In Stephen J. Gould's popular book, Wonderful Life, he points out that the Burgess Shale Cambrian fossils include ""a range of disparity in anatomical design never again equaled, and not matched today by all the creatures in the world's oceans.""38   Further, these fossils contain some twenty to thirty kinds of arthropods*** that cannot be placed in any modern group. The modern arthropods, consisting of almost a million species, can all fit into four major groups. But ""one quarry in British Columbia, representing the first explosion of multicellular life, reveals more than twenty additional arthropod designs."" Today there are about 38 phyla in existence, but the Canadian, Chinese and other Cambrian sites reveal over fifty phyla.38  There has been a decrease in diversity (probably due to global catastrophes). This is the reverse of what evolutionary theory predicts.38  Besides diversity, the Burgess Shale shows exquisite detail, right down to ""the last filament of a trilobite's gill,"" or the last meal in a worm's gut.38  The Chengjiang site has even greater detail, and is earlier. According to Paul Chien, the chairman of the biology department at the University of San Francisco, said the preservation is such that internal organs, nerves, and even the water ducts of jellyfish are observable.38  Researchers found striking similarities between the compound eyes of the Cambrian trilobites and those of modern insects. According to Riccardo Levi-Setti, ""Trilobites could see in their immediate environment with amazingly sophisticated optical devices in the form of large composite eyes. ... The number of individual optical elements in the compound eye could vary from approximately one hundred to more than fifteen thousand in a single eye, a range not very different from that found in modern insects.""38  The conclusion is that the eye, a complex visual system, was fully formed and functional extremely early in the fossil record. Obviously, this is not predicted by evolutionary theory.38  Until recently, the phylum of vertebrates had been considered a later arrival in evolutionary history. But not now! Even the vertebrate phylum now extends into the Cambrian period, especially with the recent discovery of two fossil fish in China.51  The two new fossils . . . from Chengjiang are the most convincing Early Cambrian vertebrates ever found. The insects and other land invertebrates are also a very important group, and these practically all seem to be living fossils.51  These complex animals were present at the beginning of multicellular life and did not appear later as is predicted by evolutionary theory.38  Evolution does not explain the abrupt appearance of complex forms of life early in the fossil record or these fossils' unequaled diversity. The implication of the Cambrian explosion of diverse, fully functional, and multicellular life is that evolutionary theory is falsified.38  Life did not start out simple and evolve into more complex and diverse animals; it was complex and diverse right at the beginning. This contradiction between the fossil data and the predictions of evolutionary theory falsifies the theory.38  ""The facts of paleontology seem to support creation rather than evolution.

One thing she keyed on was evolution as it applies to a larger ecosystem. I couldn't quite grasp what she was asking because I don't think she herself was very clear on the question, but to make a long story short, I got the distinct impression that she simply can't wholeheartedly accept evolution because she can't begin to fathom the complexity of the science behind it. I have told her time and time again: ""Just because you don't understand something, that doesn't make it wrong."" I see this same pattern here in your words, Frog. You're talking about wild collisions of atoms and saying that the foundations who donate hundreds of millions of dollars a year to research know less than you do, because they're wasting their money.

Did it ever occur to any of you that you should actually learn about the topic before you try to instruct others? One thing that is always true of science is that it is predictive - and ""God did it"" offers no predictions.  However, if you wish to assert that ancient mythology is a historical record of the events, you have made assertions that can be checked. For example, if you assert that the creation took place about 6 to 10 thousand years ago, then we can predict that nothing in the entire universe can be older than that. But clearly there are. And we have observed events that happened longer ago than that. For example, SN 1987 A was a supernova that was observed in 1987 within 3 hours of the first light reaching earth. It's distance from earth has been measured by more than one method. It is 170,000 light years away. In other words, SN 1987 A exploded 170,000 years ago. A creationist's answer is to claim that his god created the light already on its way to earth, complete with the history of an explosion that never happened. Ultimately, creationism falls back on an untestable miracle for which there is no evidence.  So if you want to believe in miracles and mythology, great! But if you wish to argue science, then shouldn't you at least learn what it is? If you claim that a theory is wrong shouldn't you at least know what that theory is?  By the way, I am getting the definition of evolution from memory. I have been using it for many years. It was first stated some 70 or 80 years ago. Anyone who has taken a course in evolutionary biology heard a similar definition the first day of class. Any text on evolutionary biology or that has a chapter on evolution will have a similar definition. It is common knowledge - and that's why I ask, if you don't know what evolution is, how do you know that you are opposed to it?"

Apparently you dont care if the law disadvantages or is unfair to others, as long as it doesn't hurt you, you're OK with it.  More evidence of your selfish motives, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it sort of disqualifies you from being objective and reasonable about the abortion issue. Its obvious if you were in the fetus' position, you'd be against abortion.

That's why I keep pointing out why it would be a bad thing to enslave people or oppress people because it hurts everyone in the end. That's what causes wars and crime a lot of the time. So yeah, I do go with what's best for me, but why should I go with any other way?  If I was a fetus, well who knows what I'd think. That's a whole other debate that some other people have already gotten into but which I think is kind of pointless. My whole point is that we kill people every day whether you like it or not, so this whole right to life thing is nonsense. You may not be the one pulling the trigger, but you always contribute to deaths. But we try to select which deaths we cause so that those deaths will lead to the most happiness for everyone else. And I think that allowing abortion does lead to more happiness for society. And before you try to show me polls about abortion to prove that many people disagree with it, and so it causes them unhappiness, that's not the only thing I'm talking about. I'm talking about the unhappiness of the child born into an ungrateful family, the potential criminal problems, and all the other things that have already been mentioned. And yes, those are only potential problems, but that's how society works. We give people jobs based on their percieved potential, we admit people to college based on potential.

While many people may argue that you CAN proove the existance of the wind by observing its effects, this is not really a valid way to a proof in physics. In the end, it comes down to faith. We can see the effects of the wind, we can feel the effects of the wind, so we believe it is there.","actually, proof of something comes down to 2 things: agreeing on what the definition of the thing is, and agreeing on evidence that verifies the thing  wind is defined as movement of air. air moves, therefore wind exists. this has been proven. i dont know what kind of definition you used, but it doesnt seem like your assignment is that difficult.  God, on the other hand, is elusive even at the definition stage. he is sometimes defined as creator of the world, a higher force, all-powerful, greatest being possible, love, etc...  unless a definition is agreed upon, even beginning to prove existance is difficult. suppose we define God as love. love exists, therefore God exists. however, not everybody agrees to this definition. suppose we define God as creator of the universe. sciences states the the universe was created spontaneously, therefore God doesnt exist. therefore, for some, either this definition is not satisfactory or the conclusion of the scientists isnt satisfactory.  finding proof for the existence of God becomes increasingly difficult when Gods definition gets constantly revised and adjusted. if we could simply agree on the definition for God then we could begin to find a proof."

Neither challenge is persuasive....In support, Rybar cites, paradoxically, the Supreme Court decision in United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939), where the Court upheld the constitutionality of a firearms-registration requirement against a Second Amendment challenge. Rybar draws on that holding, relying on the Miller Court's observation that the sawed-off shotgun in question had not been shown to bear 'some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.' Brief of Appellant at 24-25; Miller, 307 U.S. at 178. Drawing from that language the contra positive implication, Rybar suggests that because the military utility of the machine guns proscribed by Section(s) 922(o) is clear, a result contrary to that reached in Miller is required, and the statute is therefore invalid under the Second Amendment....We note first that however clear the Court's suggestion that the firearm before it lacked the necessary military character, it did not state that such character alone would be sufficient to secure Second Amendment protection.

But the are a particle and an anti-particle and the net energy is zero so energy is conserved. These ideas come from quantum mechanics. A virtual particle is a particle that can never be directly detected, but whose existence does have measurable effects. One of those effects is the Casimir effect. It is an attractive pressure between two flat, parallel metal plates placed very near to each other in a vacuum. The pressure is due to the reduced number of virtual particles between the plates. When the plates are very close, only particles of certain resonant wavelengths can exist between them. Thus, more particles on the outside push the plates together.

If you make the keel thick in an effort to reduce the hogging and snaking, you reduct the room available inside. Even at that, it would be impossible to eliminate all of the flexing and that flexing would spring the planks of the hull. There is no calking that has been devised that can fill an ever changing gap between planks.  And, of course, recourse to a miracle is the standard creationist answer when faced with evidence that their mythology isn't historic. ""POOF! Goddidit!"" And so, what is the point of the whole exercise in the first place? Why didn't God just POOF the ark into existance or just POOF anyone he didn't like out of existance? He wanted to teach the only just man in the world a lesson? Sure worked. First thing Noah did was to get drunk."

Were they allowed to go inside and talk to the women? Of course not. Most of the rabid anti-abortionists, (the ones that show up outside the clinic with their disgusting signs and propaganda, shrieking at the women, throwing rotten fruit and worse at them) have absolutely no right to speak to these women, as their contact with them could be at the least disturbing and at the worst violent and dangerous. Thankful though I am for the ordinance, it is not enough, and in some cases, it is not enforced. There are cases of the police ""looking the other way"" because they agree with the protestors. In my opinion, these protestors should be arrested and prosecuted for harassment, assault, unlawful assembly, and anything else we can pin on them. Yes, in america the first ammendment gives you the right to peaceful assembly and protest, and that right should be protected.  But with any other protest, the organisers have to get the proper permits, and police have to be on hand in case anything gets unruly.

They are our police officers, the anonymous tipsters, and the countless law abiding citizens in our country. The way your talking you act like the only way for the good citizens to win is to have a gun or be ready to use force.  If you want to do one better you could eliminate guns completely in order to lower the risk of deaths in gun fights. You can't debate the fact that less guns equals less murders. You can debate that without guns there would be more deaths to other weapons although you can't debate it would be to the same extent as gun murders and crimes would be.  You talk about hope like it rests on whether you have the ability to kill another person or not. The criminals are the ones that have to hope. They are the ones who are outnumbered thousands to one and their weapon isn't going to protect them from that.   I'm not trying to make the case that guns should be banned. I'm not trying to make the case that all criminals will get caught. I'm not trying to make the case that we are already in the best possible system for fighting crime or when it comes to gun control. What I am saying is that you cannot possible expect that just because our society doesn't expect people to carry around guns that the criminals will be able to walk all over us. They are the ones who are running most of the time. They are the ones who have their lives taken away most of the time.

The claim had been made by your side... that he hadn't published an attempt to apply his filter. And, that he was running scarred. Are you now asking me to show where he has successfully demonstrated his filter, or are you asking me if he's attempted to demonstrate his filter...? And now you want his publication in a particular form too! Another slight of hand.  Despite this I countered that he has published.  I said Dembski had come up with a filter  The accusation was that he hadn't applied this to a biological system.  Yet everyone seems to be able to critique this 'invisible' application.  Now with typical aplomb WJA chimes in and you don't go down the path of SLP in actually making any claim. You want me to come up with the goods.  This is the neat trick. You've diverted things away from SLP's ludicrous and biased claim.  The claim was made by SLP without any proof.  The onus is on SLP to provide such proof. I have shown otherwise even if it is 'second hand evidence'. The inference from all the critiques quite clearly suggest that they have seen it applied, and reject it as a failure.  Nice try WJA. A small shift again of the argument.   However, because I'm trying to educate you I suggest your read the following.  ""In the actual encounter, Dembski began by overviewing his methods for design detection as developed in The Design Inference. He then  sketched how these methods apply to biology  and why he thought they provided in-principle objections to undirected natural causes, including Kauffman's self-organizational processes, generating the key item that his methods detect, namely, specified complexity or complex specified information. Dembski developed his argument as follows: the only way for self-organizational, Darwinian, and other naturalistic methods to generate specified complexity is by in essence dissolving the actual complexity (or improbability). What seems highly improbable is therefore no longer improbable once one knows the right naturalistic process. Dembski indicated that there were good reasons to think that no such reduction of complexity or improbability would be possible in the case of systems like the bacterial flagellum.  He also adverted to some of the techniques developed in his forthcoming book titled ""No Free Lunch"" for computing the probabilities of discrete combinatorial objects like the bacterial flagellum. "" http://www.arn.org/docs/pjweekly/pj_weekly_011119.htm  This suggests that a book is about to appear mysteriously out of the ether...  So, go read the book  ""No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity Cannot Be Purchased Without Intelligence"". Unless you think it's not 'published'. Oh, look it has been published! It's a miracle.   As far back as post 29 the answer was provided for one and all by SLP who wrote: ""Unfortunately, Dembski and his ""explanatory"" filter are more hot air than substance. He has claiming to have 'discovered' desing (sic) in nature by using the 'filter', but for some strange reason, he has yet to publish his amazing discovery. he said he was going to do it in ""Mere Creation"", then he said it would be iun (sic)  No Free Lunch  - so tell us , IS IT actually in his newest collection of apocryphal tall tales, or is is (sic) just assumed that he has done so?""  The simple answer is 'yes he has'.  This mystery book exists. It's even been criticised by people on your side ""In his book, No Free Lunch,  Dembski presents the bacterial flagellum as the premier example of a biological system that, because he judges it to be both complex and specified, must have been actualized by the form-conferring action of an unembodied intelligent agent. However, a critical examination of Dembski?s case reveals that, 1) is is built  on unorthodox and inconsistently applied definitions of both ?complex? and ?specified,? 2) it employs a concept of the flagellum?s assembly that is radically out of touch with contemporary genetics and developmental biology, and 3)  it fails to demonstrate  that the flagellum is either ?complex? or ?specified? in the manner required to make his case. If the bacterial flagellum is supposed to demonstrate ID, then ID is a failure."" http://www.iscid.org/ubbcgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=000057;p=  As I said, people on your side are out there criticising him all the time.

""In one sample of state prisoners, 74 percent agreed that one reason burglars avoid residences when people are at home is that they fear being shot. At the same time, burglars also report that guns are of considerable value to them.... Interviews with active burglars suggest that they typically prefer items that are easy to carry, easily concealed, and have high 'pound for pound' value. As one burglar reported: 'A gun is money with a trigger'....Results from the Uniform Crime Reports and NCVS data suggest that gun prevalence may increase the odds of being burglarized. Our analyses find that a 10-percent increase in a county's gun ownership rate is associated with a 3-percent to 7-percent increase in the likelihood that a home will be burglarized. The likelihood that a burglary is 'hot' (that is, that a resident is at home during the break-in) does not appear to be affected by the prevalence of gun ownership....One possible reason why the risk of burglary increases with gun prevalence is that guns are valuable loot....Keeping a gun at home is unlikely to provide a net benefit to the rest of the community in the form of burglary deterrence. If anything, residences in a neighborhood with more guns may be at greater risk of being burglarized. The upshot is ironic: Guns are often kept to protect the home, but the aggregate effect of keeping guns at home may be to increase the victimization rate."" http://www.jointogether.org/gv/news/summaries/reader/0,2061,566426,00.html Criminals fear being shot, but they also want to steal guns.","So you are saying that because the gun is of value you should just let the burgular take everything else of value, Rape your wife and possibly kill you all because you might get shot?

Are you saying that you aren't up to it? If you want I'll start calling you names too. Isn't it funny how creationists begin that sort of thing when someone doubts their dogma? As for thinking outside the box, I can guarantee that evolutionary biology requires more thinking and encountering of new and difficult ideas than creationism does. To study science no one begins by signing an agreement to believe only religious dogma or to reject any scientific fact that disagrees with the mythology of bronze age herdsmen. In fact, you make a name in science by challenging established dogma. Just think about the famous scientists.  Besides, how can I speak to you on an equal level about science when you don't seem to understand it very well. Anyone who demands proof has no idea what science is or how it works.  Then shall we start with a discussion of the carina? I wasn't sure that you were familiar with the terms and it makes the discussion easier to use the correct terms.

If you can call me a pompous XXX the it should be OK if I call you ignorant, isn't it? Why else would you be asking me at the end of your post I claimed exactly the opposite of what I actually claimed. I'll explain at the risk of hurting your feelings again.  Herring gulls and Lesser black-backed gulls do not interbreed. They are reproductively isolated. They fit quite nicely into the definition you gave of an insipient species. So Herring gulls don't reproduce with Lesser black-backed gulls but herring gulls can reproduce with American herring gulls to the west, which can reproduce with gulls to the west and so on until you get to the Lesser black-backed gull (which don't reproduce with Herring gulls) They are classified as separate species even though they are at the extreme ends of a single population. They illustrate one way that species develop. There are other examples of ring species, the most famous being a salamander in California and a bird around the Tibetan plateau.  So how about this? Genetic studies were done of Brown bears from around the world. Their DNA was very similar and they seem all populations seem to be able to interbreed as far as we know. Except for the Brown bears of the ABC Islands Although they look like other Brown bears, the have distinctive differences in their DNA. It is closer to Polar bear DNA, even though the Polar looks quite different and has characteristics not found in Brown bears. But guess what. All these bears can interbreed, including Polar bears with Grizzly bears.  OK. Your turn for a few insults. I have come to expect it from creationists."

I'll grant you that since he changed his mind in the prophecy directly before this one.  What we are debating is the fact that the Bible has a flaw in it. The prophecy before this one was incorrect. A correction was made later to make up for this. Then this prophecy was incorrect. There is no correction ever made. Hence there is a flaw in the Bible. Most Christians will accept the Bible as flawless and this single flaw could have the power to change minds and make people question how a perfect God allowed the only proof of him to be flawed. So if you are correct that God did change his mind, then you have to also accept that my point has been made and that there is a flaw in the Bible. You can downplay this flaw but it is still there for all to see.  To expand on some of what you said, don't you think what you detailed there would go against what most Christians believe about God?

Also if everything that occurs is Gods will, then isn't it Gods will that an abortion take place if it does occur?  I won't debate that an aborted baby could have been responsible for an important event in the future if it had been born, but this is a rare event. I submit to you this idea as well if you like the cases of rare events. What if one of those babies grew up and killed someone who would be responsible for an important future event had he lived long enough to do so? That is a rare case as well.

God diliberately kept information fro them because He knew they would not understand, just like you would deliberately keep information not pertinent to you children because they will not understand. How we came about wasn't as pertinent as why and who, so thats what He told us. It could kinda be like the stork. You know your kids won't understand (and don't yet need to) about sex and child birth, so when your five year old comes up and asks where do babies come from SOME parents (not all, I know I won't, but SOME do) say that the stork brings babies. They put a myth in place of a fact that the children don't need to know. Furthermore, even if God did explain evolution, if the men He explained it to didn't understand. Which they probably wouldn't have seeing as they had no sense of time, biology, genetics, or even basic anatomy (all pertinent to evolution) then they would have transcribed something VERY different. If God told them ""In the beginning I created the Heavens and the Earth in the first billion years, I said let there be light and I caused a tiny powerful ball of matter with an enormous mass to explode and with that came the heavens and the Earth. At first the Earth w"" Lets see primitive man wouldnt have understood 'billion years' 'tiny ball of matter with an enormous mass' 'explode.' So what do we have left. ""In the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth, He said Let there be Light and there was."" I know that isn't the Bible verse, but do you see my point. Even if God didn't as you say 'diliberately' (which in my opinion implies malice, but you may use that word in reference to God if you wish to do so) keep the information from us. In the minds of man it could have been simplified enormously to a point of mythological proportions. A modern day example would be the theory of relativity. Have you ever had it explained to you. I have. It is extremely complicated and few people REALLY understand it. Anyway, when my father explained it to me when I was about 16, we talked about it for several hours (literally) and through all his complicated explanations and answers to my questions, my brain pretty much reduced it to ""As you approach the speed of light time slows down compared to things not going that fast. But that does not mean when you slow back down you will not return to their same 'time.' Time IS relative."" Now I still don't understand how time is relative or how time would slow down as you reach the speed of light, or even how you would return to their same 'time.' I can simply regurgitate the facts. Man back then wouldn't have understand evolution so it would have been simplified similarly. Simplify it to just the facts, ignore the how and put it into a time frame that you can understand and thats good enough."

Will I take more in the future...sure if I think they have anything to add to my knowledge. In fact there is a professor at my college who is a creationist and if he ever speaks I will certainly go to hear him. So am I close minded or afraid to learn something new or change my opinion...no. I look to find the truth through facts and knowledge. Because after all when you find truth you find God. So instead of attempting to turn my question back to me, why don't you actually ask yourself...are you afraid to take a detailed class in evolution taught by someone with a PhD...could Creationism stand up to it. I can't answer that question for you, and I can't even tell you whether you should try to find the answer or not, it's your choice.

"(1078, 5)",-3.4,The theory of evolution is not in jeopardy unless we start burning books and outlawing its teaching.,"I would like to propose reasons that the theory of evolution is in jeopardy. First, you must realize that evolution is still a theory. Otherwise it would be called the Law of Evolution. We have the laws of physics, the laws of chemistry, the laws of mathematics, the laws of thermodynamics. These are all proved and documented and provide the basis of all our technology. They are true and wholeheartedly accepted by everyone. They are the Laws of the Universe. For evolution to become a law, it must fall in line with the other laws. There can be no contradictions. The truth must be the truth.   The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that Entropy must remain the same or increase. Entropy is the tendency toward chaos. Increasing entropy means increasing chaos. The universe is winding down on an irreversible path. Every process that takes place in nature, whether mechanical, electrical, chemical, or biological is winding down, becoming more chaotic. All processes will finally cease, and the Universe will stop. That is a scientific fact.   If the Universe is running down, becoming more chaotic all the time, how is it possible for any material to suddenly become more orderly, more organized, more complex. Scientists say, that random encounters of atoms, molecules, joining and splitting, eventually create order. I'm sorry, that's in direct contradiction to the Second Law. It would also violate the statisically probability of such an occurrence even over billions of years, especially in light of the complexity of organized biological systems and processes.   Which brings me to the second reason that evolution is in jeopardy: there is a huge difference between living and non-living things. There is a gigantic leap forward required to produce even a single-celled amoeba from a goo that contains all the elements required to make an amoeba. The goo is total chaos. The amoeba is a highly organized and complex living creature. The odds of random mixing by weather, earthquake, etc. that would produce an amoeba would be one in a billion billion billion. It's not going to happen.  Thirdly, look at DNA. Scientists are mapping the human genome, the very basis of life itself. What are they finding? Recorded information that literally contains the blueprint of a human being. Information so complex and so vast that it is taking literally years to decipher. And every bit of the human body carries DNA. Theorically, it is possible to take this blueprint and create a whole new human. How can a living creature so complex be an accident of nature?   Fourth, how do you explain human consciousness? How does this highly complex body of flesh and blood with its organic brain have the ability to not only be aware of the world, but also be aware of himself as a unique person? There is no biological or medical reason determined so far, despite decades of study. What freak accident could possibly have occurred to give the first descendant of apes the first spark of awareness?"

I don't have an opinion and stand no chance against those who know beyond infinite times more on this topic than I do.  But regardless, I still have a question.  Maybe I'm wrong but, isn't lowering shootings a siginificant point in those who want to ban guns? So they want to make the guns illegal and thus the only place they would be available is in the ""black market"".  Now we all know that guns in cases serve as a form of self protection from other people who would want to commit harm to the indiviusal.  It is simply an average law abiding man who wants to have this pistol or handgun to protect him and or his family from those who would want to bring harm upon him family. The illegalization of these handguns would make it virtually impossible for those law abiding to get one of these guns in hopes of protecting his loved ones.  I suppose a hope for those for the illegalization is that this would keep guns out of the hands of criminals. But that doesn't make much sense. Making it against the law to own a gun is not going to stop the selling, posession and illegal use of them. Instead it only takes protection out of the hands of those who who only want to use it for ""good"" and does not do alot for those who would use it for ""evil"".  Like weed, making guns illegal would not lower the crime rate, but instead may very well increase those innocent dead because they were without protection.","Your argument is akin to saying ""We can't stop people over-dosing on heroin, so let's legalise it""  Why have limitations on hand-grenades or mines? People use mines all over the world for bad. Obviously laws aren't going to work... but perhaps the laws are also suggestive of a particular ethos; a set of standards that the community believe are necessary for a civil society. Thus, a nation such as New Zealand, or Australia, promotes a more 'community-minded' citizen then an 'individualisticlly-minded' citizen. This also carries over into general attitudes towards one's neighbours. In America, you're in fear that what little you have is going to be plundered by blacks or hispanics, or commies or someone. Even the government's out to rip away your rights. This 'seige' mentality permeates American society.  For the interest of those who aren't aware, gun ownership for self-protection (from nasty criminals) is not protected by the Constitution ... it is written to state that a well-armed militia is necessary for the protection of rights."

Your total ignorance of science is apparent from the very fact that you think that disagreement on some details casts a doubt on the grander theory. (Of course, you don't seem to see disagreements on major tenets of faith as evidence against your form of christianity, based primarily on mythology) A minority of evolutionary biologists disagrees with the theory that birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs. One of those is Allan Feduccia, a favorite son of creationists, in spite of the fact that gives no credence to creationism. Creationists even offer quotes from Feduccia as if they were somehow supportive of creationism. Those who do are, without question, totally ignorant of the principles of logic and science. Disproof of one hypothesis does not support any other. Thus, any arguments against evolutionary theory are not support for creationism. Creationism must either stand or fall on its own merits.

"(389, 6)",-4.6,"unemployment did not decrease during reagans administration, it increased. and the deficit remained extremely high until clinton's administration.  can you please respond to FDR and his New Deal that saved the country?","FDR saved this country? If I recall, it was in 1933 that, because of a combination of weakened capital situations from Reconstruction Finance Corporation loans which published lists of the loan takers, and a nation-wide banking holiday, banks around the country went through a new wave of demise, dropping the D/C and D/R ratios so sharply that, in one month alone, the money stock (M2) fell a whopping 4 1/2%.  Wasnt it under FDR that the NIRA codes, and, after 1935, the NLRA, enacted minimum wages, driving up nominal wages and thus unemployment?  Wasnt it during FDR administration that the reserve ratio was *doubled*, sending us back into another recession starting 1937?  The only thing FDR ""saved"" was the depression for a couple more years.  -GFA."
"(870, 0)",-4.2,"Your selective memory is at work again. As I recall, in Waco military vehicles and equipment were used against the Branch Davidians. Nevermind the presence of members of Delta Force which was denied, at first, by the government. Then they were caught lying again about using flammable tear gas which, ironically enough, is banned by the Geneva Convention for use against enemy troops. In the end, the 'open and shut case' the government thought they had, blew up in their faces because of their lies and abuses. I also recall, at some point around the time of the Great Depression that U.S. troops were called out to quell food riots in New York, I think it was. There were a couple of young officers present by the name of MacArthur and Patton, I believe. There are a few other instances I'm sure.","And would guns in the hands of citizens have stopped that? Or does publicity, which has only increased since those events, stop them? Your selective reading ability is at work."

"(1367, 1)",-4.25,"In reality, there are no concrete 'reasons' for believing in God. If you believe in God, you believe based on faith. There is no incontrovertible physical evidence anywhere to even suggest that God exists... unless you first believe through faith that God exists.","This statement is wrong. People from hundreds of years before Jesus was born prophesied that a baby would be born, in Bethlehem, of a virgin. There were over 50 more prophesies that were made about his life, and the sacrafice he made to pay for the sins of man, and the bigest one of all...He completely fufilled scripture when he rose from the dead. These men were inspired by Jesus, God, how can you argue that he is not the christ? The odds of one man filling all the prophesies is impossible. And these scriptures have been unchanged for the past 2000-2500 approx years! Thats proof for me that Jesus existed and that he is God. PM me if you like."
